Makoto Tanaka, an office worker belonging to the Black Guild.

Despite being one of the world's top-class explorers, he was overworked by the guild for a low monthly salary and spent his days with dead eyes.

One day, Tanaka mistakenly distributes a video for recording to the company nationwide.
Viewers who saw Tanaka's unconventional power went wild, and the distribution eventually attracted 100 million people.

Tanaka suddenly becomes a person of the moment.
The president of the guild he belongs to gets angry at him and yells at him.

Hearing this, Tanaka is blown away and leaves the guild saying, "Then I'll quit."

Tanaka, who has become unemployed, is active as a free dungeon broadcaster and becomes more and more famous.
On the other hand, the guild that banished Tanaka was on the verge of collapse.
