TL: Sam

…

"Yo, heh" (TL: breath sounds ig?)

　I run lightly through the dungeon.

　Dungeons are roughly divided into upper, middle, lower, and deep layers, but what I'm aiming for right now is the deepest layer, the "deep layer."
<!--more-->
　Normally, it's a theory to go down little by little, but I don't have time for that right now. So I decided to go deep into the depths at once.

"Haa... I'm depressed. Sometimes I want to go home and sleep peacefully. I want to eat something warm..."

　On the way, complaining to no one in particular.

　The video is taken, but the president doesn't see such a moving scene. This much should be allowed.


"I don't want to get a pay raise, but I'm sick of all the dangerous work... I wish I could get two hours of sleep today..."



「I normally wouldn’t care, but the black guild is too much, I can’t even laugh.」

「Live strong」

「I mean, isn’t the Black Dog Guild crazy? They’re ignoring the Employment Law for Explorers.」

「I have to record it.」

「I mean, the number of viewers has increased. At first there were 3, but now there are 20.」

「Now, there’s like 10,000 people lol」



"... this phone is amazing"


　When the smartphone shakes, it vibrates and does not stop.

　I don't see the screen, but it's probably from most companies. This phone only contains business contacts and contacts of a few old friends.

　I don't do anything like SNS, and I don't think I'll be notified of that.

"Now then. Shall we go to the depths?"


　Shibuya underground dungeon is large in the centercolonnade・・・・It has become. So if you jump down that big hole, you can go to the depths at once.

　I reached the atrium and jumped down from there.

　Of course, there are few explorers who do it because it's a dangerous act. Even I wouldn't do this if I wasn't given a stupid quota.



「Gyaaaaaaa! he fell!」

「A suicide stream!」

「He’ll Die! Scary!」

「What are you doing!!」



"……hmmm?"


　The smartphone shakes again.

　I tilt my head while falling headlong.


"The phone calls are persistent today. Something may have happened, but I'm busy right now, so I'll ignore it."


　With that in mind, I ignore the vibration of my smartphone.

　Well, the drone that is filming is... well, it's following me. I'm still not used to being photographed, but I can't help it because it's a rule.

　I'm so nervous even for company records, so how embarrassing would it be if I actually distributed it? If you think about it, the distributor is amazing. If I do it, will I get any comments?



「Uwaaaaaaaa!! How much will he fall!」

「This is a great video, it's a valuable record.」

「I came from the bulletin board, what’s happening?」

「Shibuya Dungeon, Missed footing, Falling」

「I think I understand」



　As I was thinking about it, the ground was getting closer and closer.

　Well, it's about time to prepare for landing...as I was thinking, a big shadow approached me.


『Gaaaaaaaa! ! 』


　Flying towards me with a roar was a flying dragon with red scales, Red Wyvern.

　I'm pretty sure this is a monster from the lower layer. It seems like it thought I was food and flew away.



「What is that monster!?」

「That's a wyvern! It's quite troublesome, even an A-class explorer will have a tough time!」

「Ah. It's over.」

「It looks like it would hurt to be bitten by those fangs...」



『Gyaah! 』


　The Red Wyvern opens its big mouth and attacks me to bite me.

　When I adjust my posture in the air, I grasp the sword attached to my waist.

　And then pull it to the last minute... pull out the sword at once.

"Ho"

　The sword flash runs and the movement of the Red Wyvern stops.

　Then, the next moment, the body of the Red Wyvern is cut in two, and fresh blood is scattered around.

"Fu, this is fine"

　After defeating the intruder, I suddenly land on the ground.

　I feel a heavy weight on my feet because I fell from a high place, but at this level it's nothing.


「...Huh?! What happened!?」

「The Red Wyvern split in half on its own!?」

「You were holding a sword, but you weren't swinging it!? What's that?!」

「...Maybe it's so fast that the camera's frame rate can't keep up?」

「Is there such a stupid story! I've never heard of it!」

「No, Red Wyvern is the same, but why is this person landing normally? Didn't he fall nearly 1000 meters?」

「This is getting interesting」

「There are too many cohabitants. It's already 50,000 people.」

「Because it's going viral on social media. It's already a festival.」

"... My smartphone is noisy. How many times are you calling me?"

　I take my mind off the constantly trembling smartphone and look ahead.

　This is the depths of the dungeon. It's a dangerous area where dangerous monsters run rampant. You have to brace yourself.

"... uh, let's go out right away."

　When I looked up, many monsters appeared in front of me.

　Minotaur to Ogre, Death Knight to Basilisk. They are all dangerous monsters.

『Lulu……』

　Behind them is a giant dragon with brown scales, the "Tyrant Dragon". He's tough, so he doesn't want to fight, right?

"Now, it's time for business...! ”

　I held the sword firmly in my right hand and plunged into the crowd of monsters.
