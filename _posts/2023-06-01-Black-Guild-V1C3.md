『Gaaaaa!! 』



　It was a group of ogres that rushed in while raising their roars.

　A frightening face on a muscular body. I had a hard time when I fought for the first time. However,
<!--more-->



"tch…"



　I cut them down as they pass each other.

　It's true that it's a highly durable opponent, but if you cut off its head, it won't be able to move., and it doesn't have any special abilities.

　It is a weak category among the monsters that appear in the depths.



「There’s no way he just did that to an ogre」

「Ogre was an A-rank monster, wasn't it...?」

「He defeated it so easily. Is this really a strong monster?」

「Even an A-rank explorer would have a hard time fighting alone. They use weapons and use their wits, so they're troublesome monsters… at least they should be.」

「This is video synthesis, isn't it?」

「I'm from the bulletin board」

「The Black Dog Guild had such an amazing explorer! ? Wow! 」



"... You're calling me really persistently today. Even though I'm at work."



　I take my mind off the trembling smartphone and turn my gaze to a different monster.

　There was a giant chameleon-like monster, a basilisk.



　The basilisk puffs up its throat while looking at me.



「Is this a basilisk!? It's my first time seeing it!」

「Ogres also appear in the lower layers, but this guy can only be found in the deep layers.」

「It's so rare. You don't see many live videos out there.」

「It looks scary. I can't be an explorer.」

「Don't worry, you won't be able to reach the depths.」

「More importantly, this guy is about to throw out his petrifying breath! Avoid it or you'll die!」

「It's been a long time since I've seen a festival like this.」



　The basilisk shakes its head forward and tries to blow on me.

　His breath has the effect of turning opponents to stone. If that happens, it’s game over. If I had friends, I could heal them with items, but I've been solo for a long time and I don't have any friends. ―

　That's why I'm going to win before it's thrown out.



"There!"



　The moment the basilisk exhales, I thrust my sword into the slightly lower part of its swollen throat.

　Then the basilisk dies before it can open its mouth and falls down on the spot.



"It's not well known, but this is the basilisk's key point. If you miss by even a little, petrifying breath will be scattered around."



「I did not know what」

「Is it lesser known or does anyone even know?」

「How many basilisks has this guy been hunting...」

「I no longer feel uncomfortable that I can't see his movements」

「Amazing! Who is he!? A famous explorer?」(Tl: This is said in English to show it's a foreigner)

「Finally, foreigners started coming.」

「It seems that an overseas broadcaster spread the word, 'A real samurai has appeared in Japan.'」

「Oh I see. There are more than 10 million people on the stream.」

「If he's so strong, I can understand why he's given such a quota... No, I don't understand. The Black Dog Guild is crazy.」



　The smartphone continues to vibrate while fighting.

It’s more persistent than ever today. ...... Of course, I ignore it, because I get nothing but nitpicking when I answer...



『Gaaaaah!! 』



　And, a roar that shakes the dungeon resounds.

　The owner of that voice is Tyrant Dragon. A giant dragon with brown scales.

　Its danger rating is an impressive "S." It is tens of times more durable and aggressive than an ogre. It is a powerful foe with durability and attack power tens of times that of an ogre, and its mouth breathes superheated breath that melts even iron.



「What is this dragon? It's too big!」

「Hey hey hey hey he's gonna die」

「[Sad news] Mysterious swordsman dies」

「Could it be a Tyrant Dragon!? It's impossible! It's a monster that you don't know if even an S-rank party can win!」

「Please run away!」

「50 million watchers!? It's a festival!」
