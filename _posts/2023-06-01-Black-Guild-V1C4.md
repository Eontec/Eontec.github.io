…

『Buuuuuuuuu ......』


　The Tyrant Dragon fills its mouth with flames.

　The firepower of his breath is tremendous. If I were to fall victim to it, I would burn up without even a coal left.

　The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your investment is to make sure that you are getting the most out of your investment.


「What the hell is this guy doing?」

「Run!」

「He's going to die!」

「Oh, an iai. He's really good at it.」

The opponent is the Tyrant Dragon!


　The next moment, the Tyrant Dragon releases the flames it has stored up.

　A huge flame spread across my field of vision. I swung my sword as hard as I could at it.


　Then a shockwave is released from the sword, cutting the Tyrant Dragon's flames in two. The shockwave then rips through the Tyrant Dragon's solid scales, killing it.


「Ha, haaaaaa!」

「Do swords nowadays produce shockwaves?」

「Of course not!」

「It would be worse if the Tyrant Dragon was killed by a single blow!」

「Please tell me this video is fake. ......」

「Find out who this businessman is!」

「I knew the corporate warriors were strong!」

「 He's so cool!」


『Gu, uuuh ......』


　As the Tyrant Dragon falls, the other monsters stop attacking and begin to distance themselves from me.

　Apparently, Tyrant Dragon was the boss of these guys. Now that the boss is down, I don't feel like fighting anymore.

　Even if I beat him anyway, the company would take the materials. I've already met my quota, so there's no reason for me to fight anymore.


"Go. I'll let you go."


　I sheathed my sword and said that, and the monsters ran off after me.

　I'm finished sooner than I thought I would be. I'm going to get my quota of materials for the monsters and go home.


...... but first, let's just check the time.


　I opened my phone and tried to check the current time.

　But at that moment, I see something impossible.


“What......?　9999 notifications?"


　My phone was full of notifications.

　Sure, I was getting calls all the time, but 9999 notifications was clearly out of the ordinary.


　I hurriedly operated my phone to check the contents of the notification.

　Then, it was filled with notifications saying, "You received a comment '〇〇〇〇' on D Tube!" I was confused and confused. I was confused.


“Why am I getting a D-tube notification ...... and why is there a comment on my video?”


　When I opened the D-tube screen, there was a comment on the screen next to the video of me being filmed at blazing speed.

　I don't understand. What's going on?


"Wait a minute! I thought I set the streaming settings to my company's website, but I’ve been using D-tube!"


　I realized that I had made a mistake, and my blood suddenly drained from my veins.

　No way!　So everything I've done has been broadcast nationwide?


“But, my dungeon video streaming wasn't being watched by that many people, was it?”


　Praying so, I check the number of viewers of my video.

　I checked the number of viewers of the video and was surprised to see a surprising number.


"100 million viewers watching ......?"


　I almost fainted at the out-of-this-world number.

　I could understand if the number of viewers would be as large as the 2,000 or so registered users on my company account, but in reality it was far more than that.

　But in reality, it wasn't that much.

　I think that most of the famous streamers don't have more than 1 million subscribers. And yet, 100 million is a lot.......


「Oh, you finally noticed!」

「Are you watching?」

「That was cool!」

「’ Time for business,' he said.」

「That was really cool!　Can you tell me your name?」

「I saw you trending on social networking sites as the ‘corporate slave Sword Saint’!」

「Will you join our guild?」

「How did you become so strong?」


　I stare in amazement at the comments that flow by at a blistering pace.

　There was no way to cover this up. No matter what I say now, the situation will never be resolved.


　In my fading consciousness, I remembered the most troublesome thing and muttered.


"I wonder if I'm going to be forced to write a report ......."
