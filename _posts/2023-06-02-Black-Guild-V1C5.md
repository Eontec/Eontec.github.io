"Wow, ...... There's so much buzz about it......"


The day after the streaming incident.

　I woke up in my chair at work as usual and muttered to myself while watching social networking sites and online news.
<!--more-->

　The headlines on the Internet news were as follows.


The headlines read: 『Mysterious Searcher Appears to Solo the Deep End!』

『The corporate sword saint solo defeats the S-class monster Tyrant Dragon.』

『The first stream of the event reached 100 million users. Should he apply for Guinness World Records?』

『The Black Dog Guild, violating the Labor Standards Act?』

『Experts say whether the controversial video was faked or not.』


And social media,


「That guy is too strong!　Why hasn't this been mentioned before?」

「Black Dog Guild, he hid something like that? No wonder he gets so many government jobs.」

「It feels like he's a corporate slave to me ...... his eyes looked dead」

「Too many people are getting caught. If you can't tell a lie from a lie, you shouldn't be on the internet.」

「That was really cool!　Does anyone know how to contact him?」

「I normally want to scout him for our guild, but where do I contact him: ......」

「Why don't you quit the Black Dog Guild? I could definitely get into a higher-paying place.」


　I was the topic of conversation everywhere.

　I guess this is what is called "buzz”. I was not familiar with such things, having spent my days immersed in work. I wanted to get an opinion from someone who was familiar with the Internet.


"Sure, I'm probably the only crazy person who dives into the deep end solo, but is ...... really something to talk so much about?"


　I nod my head.

　It's true that I only dive solo these days, so I don't really know the level of other explorers.


　I started diving right after the dungeon was born in the world, so I thought I was a fairly strong person, but... I wonder if it's enough to cause such a fuss..


"The first thing that comes to mind is that I'm a dull-looking salaryman.　I'm in a suit and I look like a normal office worker. I have dark circles in my eyes, and I don't really look like an explorer."


　That's why people are fussing over that gap.

　Just as I'm convinced of that, my phone vibrates.


"Heyyy！？"


　I jump up on the spot in surprise and involuntarily stick to the ceiling.

　Because of what happened yesterday, I was terrified by the vibration of my phone. I won't forget that notification-ridden experience for a while. ......


　I've already disconnected from D-tube, so it shouldn't happen again.


"What now?　Um, hmm?"


　I climbed down from the ceiling and checked my phone, where it read, "Mitsuru Adachi, incoming call."

　Adachi is one of my few friends. We used to hang out a lot, but I haven't seen him at all lately. The truth is that I've been so busy that I've forgotten he even exists.


　The reason he called me at this time is no doubt related to yesterday. To be honest, I don't really want to talk about it, but it's also true that the only person I can talk to is Adachi.

　After a little hesitation, I press the call icon.


"Hello......"

"Tanaka!　I saw your stream yesterday!　hehehehe!　I was laughing throughout!　How are you feeling right now?"

"I'm hanging up."


　I hang up.

　Well, let's get ready for the first day of work. Just as I put my phone back down on my desk, the ringtone rings again. I sigh and pick up the phone again.


"What is it?"

"Sorry, sorry!　I won't mess with you anymore, so don't hang up on me. ...... pfft."

"Do you want to get hung up on again?"


I say threateningly, and Adachi apologizes profusely, trying somehow not to get cut off.

"You totally haven't changed a bit, have you?"


"I understand, I won't hang up on you. You're a hard man to deal with, aren't you?"


　To be honest, I'd like to borrow Adachi's wisdom right now. Cutting off the call won't be good for me either.

　Adachi is a good talker and has a wide circle of friends. And I'm sure he knows a lot about social networking sites. Adachi should be able to come up with a way to deal with this situation.


　Adachi thanked me for not hanging up on him and quickly cut to the chase.


"I saw the video. You're as strong as ever. I think you're even more polished than before."

"I don't need the pleasantries. What do you think I should do?"

" 'What do you think I should do?' What do you want to do first?"


　I'm troubled by Adachi asking me the opposite question.

　Well, let's see. ......


"I want to delete all the videos that are circulating."

"That's impossible."


　Adachi laughs at my wish. That's terrible.


"The number of your Warriors clipping videos is not 100 or 200, you know.　Besides, they've already spread overseas. There is a real SAMURAI in Japan! ....... It's already been translated into five languages when I checked. Give it up."

"...... I didn't know that was going to happen.


　I thought that if it was only in Japan, I could manage it, but I didn't realize that it went overseas as well.

　Come to think of it, when I was streaming it, it had comments that looked like they were from overseas. ......
