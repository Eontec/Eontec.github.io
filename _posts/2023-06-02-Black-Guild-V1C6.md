"I'll give up deleting the video then. Can you think of a way to make this situation as small as possible?"

"Hey, hey, what are you talking about, Tanaka?"
<!--more-->

　Adachi sighed deliberately.


"You've made a name for yourself, why would you want to throw it away?　You'll never get another chance like this."

"What are you talking about?　I'm not a streamer or an influencer. Being famous won't do me any good. I'll just get sarcastic comments from my boss."


　As soon as I said the word "boss," my stomach began to churn.

　I've eaten acid slime that could dissolve iron, but my stomach is not susceptible to stress.


"I'm so ingrained in the spirit of corporate slavery, Tanaka. You know what?　You should quit your job. I saw your eyes in the video, and your dark circles are too dark. I bet you're still working for that Suda guy for a low salary, aren't you?"

"I can't deny that......."


　The person named "Suda" that Adachi mentioned is the president of the company I work for.

　I, Adachi, and Suda were classmates and used to play together when we were in elementary and junior high school. We used to play together when we were in elementary and junior high school.


"But I owe the president, Suda, a debt of gratitude. To suddenly quit ...... is just not right."

"When your parents got sick, he lent you money, didn't he?　You've already returned the money and paid him back for that favor. Come on, live for yourself."


　When he said that, I felt my heart lighten.

　I had been so busy that I had never thought about that.


　I had been too busy to think about it.


"It's about Suda. 'If you quit here, you won't find another job!' is what he said"


"Damn, he's got that corrupt president thing going for him, too. Tanaka, don't take those words seriously. There are plenty of guilds that would love to have you. Besides, you don't have to belong to a company, you can go freelance."

"But you can't make money as a freelancer. I don't have the qualifications to cash in."


　The things you get in dungeons cannot be converted directly into yen.

　The first thing you need to do is to convert them into a special currency called "G." Then, you need to convert the "G" into Yen.


　To convert it into yen, you need a qualification, which is usually held by a company and not by an individual.


　It's a troublesome system, but I heard that if you don't do this, the economy can be easily destroyed.

　The things you can get in the dungeon are that valuable.


　But Adachi should know these basic facts.


"I'm not asking you to become a freelance explorer. I'm asking you to become a dungeon streamer."

"Dungeon Streamer: ...... Hey."


"Dungeon streamers, as the name implies, are people who stream their dungeon dives."

　It is true that some famous people are making a lot of money, but can I be a dungeon streamer?


"I won't force you to become one. If you do, I'll do my best to support you."

"That's reassuring. I'm counting on you."


　Adachi smiled happily when he said that.

　Adachi works for a company that supports explorers. He must know a lot about dungeon streaming.

　He's a well-tempered guy, but this guy has always been dependable.


"... I'm quitting the company, huh? I can't imagine it."


　When I think about it, I hesitate.

　Unemployed is too heavy a word for someone my age.


　I was thinking like this when Adachi, perhaps sensing how I was feeling, started talking to me.


"I hate to say this, but ...... I've always admired you, you know?"

"What?　You admire me?"


　The sudden words upset me.

　What on earth do you mean?


"I used to admire being an explorer, too. I thought I'd be active in dungeon diving. But when I saw your fighting style, I thought, 'If there's a great guy like you, I don't have to dive.' "

"Adachi ......"(Tl: Just wanted to add a "no homo" here cuz there's no yaoi tag)


　I didn't know you felt that way. The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help.


"That's why I got a job to support explorers. To support someone someday."

"What?　Who is that? Do I know you?"

"...... Well, you've always been a little slow, haven't you?"


　 He was rude.


"Anyway, I'll tell you what. If you have a hard time in your current job, you should quit it immediately. If you want, I can hire you as a tea waiter at my company."

"......I must be pretty sick to find that offer so appealing."


　When I say this jokingly, Adachi laughs and says, "Yeah, I'm very sick.

　I feel much calmer after talking to this guy. I think I can make a calm decision now.


"You can even beat a Tyrant Dragon," Adachi said. "Don't let Suda beat you.

"Thank you. I'll be in touch."


　After a short exchange of words, he hangs up the phone.

　I looked at my watch and saw that it was already time for me to leave for work. It was time for the other employees to arrive.


　Just as I was thinking this, the door to the office suddenly opened with a loud bang!　The door opens with a loud bang.

　The person who entered the office stared at me as soon as he saw me.


"......Tanaka, I hope you're ready for this."


　Akihiro Suda, the president of the Black Dog Guild and my childhood friend, said in a hushed voice.(Tl: Such a big intro to such a minor villain)
