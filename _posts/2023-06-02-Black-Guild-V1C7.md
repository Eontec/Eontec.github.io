…

"You! I hope you understand what you have done wrong ......!"


　Suda, the president of the Black Dog Guild, approaches me with an ogre-like expression on his face.
<!--more-->

　I should have been prepared for this, but when I hear his voice, my stomach starts to hurt. It seems that my mind was more fragile than I thought.


　I've been listening to him for so many years that I'm completely ingrained in his corporate guts.

　Thanks to the conversation I had with Adachi earlier, I can now look at myself objectively. If I hadn't talked to him, I might have surrendered at this point.


"Because of that stream, the company's reputation is in ruins!　How are you going to take responsibility for that!"


　Suda yelled at me, his face turning red.

　This is an everyday occurrence in our guild. He has no great managerial skills, but he is very good at using fear to control his employees.


　He has a great talent for running a black company. It's ruined my body and soul. I owe him a debt of gratitude, but if I don't ...... continue like this, I'm doomed.

　I want to live for myself from now on.


"... Other employees will come soon.  Then I'll beat you down. Prepare yourself."


　Suda smiled wickedly.

　I'm sure he's enjoying the sermon. He always says he's doing it for your sake, but that's a lie.

　He's a scumbag who likes to bully people who can never fight back. I'm so glad I was able to wake up to this.


　Even though I'm at ......, I still get sick to my stomach and my legs when I'm in front of this guy. At this rate, I doubt I'll be able to successfully rebut him.

　As I'm thinking about what to do, my phone vibrates.


"Hmm?"


　I secretly check my phone so that Suda doesn't find out.

　I see a message from Adachi, who I had been talking to earlier. What in the world is going on?


「Since it's you, you're still scared of Suda, right?　If that's the case, think, 'But I can kill this guy in an instant.' Then you won't be afraid.」


　...... I see.

　Suda used to be an explorer, so he's stronger than most people, but he hasn't dived in dungeons for a long time. I'm sure I'm stronger than him.


　If you look closely, you will see that Suda's movements are full of gaps, not those of a warrior.

　If I close the distance in 0.2 seconds and hit him in the heart, ...... yeah, it would take less than a second to kill him.


　Huh?　If you think about it that way, it might not be scary. Tyrant dragons are much scarier.

　I used to be afraid that they would make me quit my job, but now I don't care if I quit, and there's not a single part of me that's afraid.


　I can do this.

　I decided that I am ready to fight this time, so I secretly touch my phone and do a certain operation. Once I do this, there's no going back.


"Okay, ......, we've got enough people here. Tanaka, let's start ......."


　When about 10 employees gathered, Suda came in front of me with a wicked smile on his face.

　I knew he was having fun.


"Tell me, Tanaka, what you have done. Make it clear to the other employees!"

　Suda says in a voice so loud that the office shakes.

　This is his usual phrase. First, he makes the employee explain and instills a sense of guilt.

　Then, after getting them to talk, he interrupts them, silences them, and then yells at them to take control of the conversation.


　Then the employee shrinks and can't say anything. He's really a bad guy.

　The other employees are remembering what he did to them, or perhaps they have a dark look on their faces. I would have had the same look on my face.

"It was my fault for making a mistake in the stream settings and leaking the contents of the business to the outside world. I do feel bad about that."

　Saying that, Suda gave a disgusting smile.

　I guess the pattern for breaking my heart is building up in my head from here.

　If it had been before, things might have gone accordingly, but not on this particular day.

"But that's it. Right now the Internet is giving the Black Dog Guild a bad name, but it's all your fault. I had nothing to do with it."

"......You, what did you just say?'


　Suda, who looked surprised, belatedly realized that what he had said had been denied, and his face turned red.


" 'I had nothing to do with it'?!　Who the hell do you think you are?!"


　Suda angrily kicked a nearby trash can.

　The trash inside scatters, and the employees tremble at the sight of it.


"You understand that this guild is in the black, don't you, Suda?　It just came to light. If what I didn't do spread, it's my fault, but what I did spread. And you were the one who made me do it."

"Are you saying that our company is black?　I don't think so!　We pay you a minimum wage and give you a day off once a month!　And who is it that picked up you scum that no other guild would hire to work for them in the first place?"


　I laugh a little in my heart at the collection of black company quotes that overflow like hot water when I poke them lightly.

　I wonder how many people hear these words and think, 'This guild is doing it right.' I'd like to take a survey.


"Aren't you the one who cuts our salary? 　And even your time off is below the Labor Standards Act for Explorers. Do you think I haven't noticed?"

"Guu....... That's fine! I also do government work! That means I'm the government!"


　Oh, this is no good.

　This guild is already blacked out. The other employees are backing down. They will be leaving soon.


......Well, now that I've gotten a lot out of him, it's time to break the story.

　I don't want to hear any more of his annoying voice.


"Suda, I'm really sorry - I've known you for a long time."

"Oh? What are you talking about?”


　I took out my phone and showed him the screen.

　There's a huge amount of comments flowing in there. ......


「Wow, wow, the black quotes keep coming up.」

「The darkness of Japan.」

「This is already a police matter, isn't it?」

「This is too much!」

「 It's been a long time since I've seen a livestream this exciting.」

「Hey, Mr. President, are you watching this?」

「Hey, how do you feel now?　How do you feel?」

「Bankruptcy confirmed.」

「Thinking about it, If this is the case, the president can no longer escape.」

「Thank God for the retirement RTA.」

「I feel a great sense of unity.」

「I'll never be a company employee again... ......, even though the dark circles in his eyes are cute...」

「I think I'm going to retire too ......」


"Hey, what the hell is this ......!"


　Suda's face turns blue.

　He seems to have finally understood his situation.


"These days drones are very sophisticated, aren't they, Suda? They even have a camouflage mode. Thanks to that, I was able to stream this without being detected."


　I operated my phone to bring out the drone, which had disappeared until now.

　Yes, I had streamed the whole sequence of events on the D-tube. Thanks to my streaming incident, the number of subscribers to the Black Dog Guild's channel is exploding. Soon, viewers would be flocking to the site.


"Guu, this ...... stupid ......!"

"Give it up, Suda. It's time to pay your tribute."


　I told Suda, who was trembling with anger.
