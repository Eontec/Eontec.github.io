Tl: Sam

…

"You idiot......!"

　Suda looks aghast as the woman in the suit reads out the charges.
　A series of his actions and words were streamed on camera, making it impossible for him to make excuses. Why did he think he could get away with it?
　Maybe he was under the mistaken impression that the arrogant behavior he had been exhibiting toward his employees had been overlooked. Well, I guess his reign is over now.
<!--more-->
"Wait a minute!　If you want to arrest someone, you're going to have to take Tanaka with you!　He attacked me, a citizen whom you should be protecting!"
"It is true that the "Special Law for Awakened Persons" prohibits Awakened Persons from using their power outside of the dungeon without permission. Especially when wielded against civilians."

　An awakened person is a person whose special power is awakened by the appearance of a dungeon.
　It is said that awakening occurs when a substance called "magical essence" which is found in the dungeon, enters the body. The strength of the awakened person varies from person to person, and whether or not he/she awakens depends on his/her constitution.


　Once awakened, the power can be wielded outside the dungeon. That is why the Awakened are restricted from using their power by the "Special Law for Awakened Persons.


"Right?　I'm the victim here, get that ungrateful bastard!"

"Don't get me wrong. His actions are in the category of 'self-defense. If you were not an awakened person, it might have been over-defense, but in this case, both of you are awakened persons and you were the first to make a move and even used a weapon, so you are overwhelmingly more at fault."

"What did you say……!?"

　Yes, Suda used to be an explorer too. He has always been an awakened.
　That's why I won't be held liable Under the Special Law for Awakened Persons. Luckily, Suda had awakened.

　As I was feeling relieved, a woman in a suit looked back at me.
　She had long, lustrous black hair and long, slit eyes. She was so beautiful that I couldn't help but look at her.
　Her body was toned, but her breasts were large, and I couldn't help but notice them as well.

"I'm going to ask you to come to the government office too,....... Is that alright with you, Makoto Tanaka?"

　She says with a sharp, cold look in her eyes.
　Geez, I have to go to the city office? That's a hassle. ...... Hmm?　This face looks familiar?

"Don't tell me you're Amatsuki?"
"...... you just noticed that now?"


　The woman I called Amatsuki said in dismay.
　I hadn't seen her for a long time, so I didn't notice her at all. I am impressed by the fact that she has grown up so well.

　Then, Suda, who was listening to the conversation, raised his voice in surprise.

"Amatsuki means ...... Kanade Amatsuki?　Why is the chief of the First Subjugation Division coming to a place like this?

The First Subjugation Division is an elite section of the Monster Subjugation Bureau, an internal department of the Ministry of Monster control.
　All members of this section are highly skilled awakened persons, and they are active in dealing with monsters when they appear in the city and arresting awakened criminals.


　She, Amatsuki Kanade, is the section chief, or head, of the First Subjugation Division.


"If the offender is an awakened person, someone from the Defeat Section is supposed to accompany them. If the offender escapes, it is impossible for ordinary people to pursue and secure them."

"I understand that, but ...... why is a top official like you coming out here?　I didn't do anything that bad!"


　Suda roared.

　No, I'm sure he's done some bad things,...... but it's certainly strange that Amatsuki came out for a small guy like Suda.


　Strong and smart, and on top of that, she's a ridiculously beautiful woman, and she's a successful leader in the Ministry of Monster Control. Even though she's younger than me, she's the head of the First Subjugation Division, so I can tell her high level of ability.


　We used to dive dungeons together and we used to get along well.
One is an elite, the other a corporate slave. Why is there such a gap between the two of us? It's sad.(Tl: First Heroine? But why do I feel like his backstory might have been more interesting than this novel?)

"There is no deep meaning in my coming here. I was just available."

　 Amatsuki is supposed to be quite busy, but really?
　 While I am wondering if he came to see someone, I feel a strong gaze coming from Amatsuki. When I turn to look at her, she looks away from me.
　 Is it possible that she hates me?

"You guys, take Suda away."

　 Amatsuki orders her subordinates, and they, dressed in suits, swiftly take Suda away.
　 It's an effortless and coordinated move. I can see that they have been training regularly.
　
"Let go of me!　I'm the president!　Hey, Tanaka!　Don't think you can get away with this!"

　 Suda was taken away, screaming until the very end.
　This finally put an end to my resignation fiasco.

"Makoto Tanaka. I'd like to talk to you as well. You'll have to go with me voluntarily."
"Ah, can we talk about that later?　I haven't slept well for the past few weeks, and I'm at my wits' end."
"Eh, no, but"

　　If it had been a government official I didn't know, I would have gone with him, but with Amatsuki, I think it's safe to be a little lenient.

"I'll talk to you, just give me a call. See you later."

　With that, I tossed her my business card and leapt out the building's window. I'm on the seventh floor, so I'd die if I were a normal person, but it doesn't matter as an awakened person.
　I jumped and decided to leave the company in style ......, or rather, retire.

　The moment I stepped out of the building, I thought I heard, "I came all this way to see you!" but it was probably just my imagination. Amatsuki is a distant presence now, and I doubt we will ever dive in a dungeon together again as we did in the past. (TL: I really want to hear this story(╥﹏╥))


...

Tl Note: So I also got 3 chapters out today, And We've Officially resched the end of Volume One, I'll go back to 2 chapters per release and if all goes well I'll catch up with the author before long, luckily, Author-san is active with releases, so we won't be getting cut off antime soon. Maybe I'll pickup another novel then, give comments and suggestions
