TL: Sam

…

「Tell him, Tanaka!」

「This is a clean Japan.」

「Suda! How do you feel now?」

「 〇〇ァ, It's become a common phrase these days.」(Tl: both Tanaka and Suda's names follow this format:"田中ァ", and "須田ァ")

「I'm so happy I ate five bowls of white rice.」

「That's too lame.」
<!--more-->

「Tanaka......, you're the star of all the employees.」(Tl: Funny cuz employee here also translates to livestock xD)

「Is this where the festival will be held today?」

「I've reported you to the Labor Bureau.」

「Suda-kun's reactions are all so petty and weedy.」


　Just glancing around, I saw a large number of comments.

　Okay, a lot of viewers are properly coming. I haven't checked, but I'm sure the social networking sites are all abuzz right now.


"You can't get away now, Suda. So many eyes saw what you did. Or do you want to frighten them into keeping their mouths shut like you always do?　Well, I doubt if you can stop the mouths of all 200,000 viewers now."


"You, you ......!"


　Suda's face is bright red and his fists are shaking. If he goes that far, there is nothing more he can do.

　What this guy usually does is rule by fear. He's not the smartest guy in the world, although he's smart enough to know it:

　There is no way he can come up with a way out of this predicament.


"Tanaka, what the hell are you doing? Why did you do this?　Are you trying to get back at me for using you like this?"

"I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel that way. I wasted a lot of valuable time because of you. But ...... that's already in the past, it doesn't matter. What matters is the future."

"What do you mean, by 'the future'?"


　Suda tilted his head.


"I'm going to live for myself from now on. I'm going to quit this company first for that purpose. I haven't decided what I will do after that, but I will either live as a freelancer or find another job."


　Suda lets out a small laugh in response.

　This is the way he laughs when he makes fun of someone.


"You, a freelancer?　Re-employment?　What the hell are you talking about?　You know what?　You're nothing without me!　You can't work anywhere else!"


　Suda's voice was shrill as he yelled at the employees around him, "And you too!" .

　I don't know how I managed to work for such a guy for so long. ......


"I understand your point. Then why don't we ask them if I can work for somewhere else?"

"Oh?　What the hell are you talking about?"

"Thank goodness 200,000 people are here for this stream. Oh, three hundred thousand people already? Why don't we ask them?"


　I spoke to the drone.


"If I leave this company, is there any place that will hire me?"


　The moment I ask this, a large number of comments begin to flow.


Scarlet Wolf Guild: 「Yes, yes!　Please join our guild!」

Golden Lion Guild: 「No, ours!　We'll give you twice as much money as any other!」

The Silver Cat Guild: 「Well, ...... I'd be happy if you would come to my place, .......」

Obsidian Bear Guild: 「How about me?　I'd love to have a nice guy like you!」

Bronze Serpent Guild: 「If you join us, ...... we'll take care of that deafening garbage.」


　One after another, solicitations fly in from the official accounts of various guilds.


　Some of them are well-known guilds that are difficult to join.

　I've never been asked to join a guild like this before, so my heart is filled with emotion. Oh no, I'm going to cry.

　Some of the comments were, 「Please team up with me!」 or 「I'll assist you, so why don't you become a freelancer?」

　I think it was a joke, but some of them even said, 「I want to work for you permanently!」 What a thing to say.
　Everyone is so kind.


"Here's your answer, Suda. Your brainwashing is over. No words can get through to me."(Tl: That’s one way to give a slap to the face)

"You, you, you, ......!"


　But this guy had not given up yet.


"Who was it that got you, a poor student, into my father's company?　Who paid for your parents' hospital bills?　It was all me!　You're betraying a man to whom you owe so much!"


"I've already repaid you. You're the one who betrayed me. The old me actually wanted to work with you."

"Shut up, you ungrateful bastard!"


　Furious, Suda opens a desk drawer and pulls out a dagger from inside.
　This is a deadly weapon, the kind you would use in a dungeon, isn't it? If you take out such a thing outside the dungeon, you will be in violation of the Dungeon Management Law.


"You'll die here, Tanaka!"


　Suda grips it with his right hand and thrusts it toward my stomach.
　The screams of the employees spread throughout the company. But I was perfectly calm.


"...... It's too slow."


　The monster's movements were much slower than those of the monsters that appear in the depths.

　This guy used to be a lot stronger, but he's totally fallen off his game.

　I slap Suda's Dagger with my hand

　Suda's hand swells up bright red and he drops the knife to the ground.


"Gah!"

"It's over, Suda. You should know a little bit about people's pain."

　I punched Suda in the gut.


"Gusto!"


　I was pretty easy on him, but Suda's body bent backwards, and he was blown away.

　Then he slammed into the wall like a bullet and fell to the floor!

　Phew...it was refreshing.

　I hope he learns a little from this.
