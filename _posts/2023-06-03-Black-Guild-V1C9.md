Tl: Sam

…

"Ta-Tanaka..."

　I had already informed him of my intention to resign and was about to leave, when Suda stood up.

"I won't forgive you, Tanaka,......, for making me look like a fool,......!"

　Suda's eyes are still filled with anger.
<!--more-->

　Even standing seems to be painful, but it seems that his heart is not broken yet. I guess his mountainous self-esteem won't allow him to stay down.

　If I attacked him any more, he might die, so it's hard for me to do anything.

"You guys!　What the hell are you doing?　Kill that criminal who raised his hand against me!"

　Suda shouted, looking as if he didn't know which one of us was the criminal.

　Naturally, the employees were puzzled, and were questioning what they should do.

"You really are a bunch of useless employees, you know that?　You!　Just stop him!　You'll get a pay cut!"(Tl: What a boss ¬_¬)

"Hey!"

　Suda spots an employee and uses his black magic to win the heart of the employee, telling him, "If I stop paying you now, you'll be in trouble," or "You won't be able to work in this industry anymore.

　The employee quickly becomes Suda's puppet.

"I'm sorry. I'll just hold you down and won't hurt you. ......"

　The employee, who succumbed to the threat, faced me with his bare hands.

　This employee had joined the company last year and was one of the leading youngsters, as I recall.

　I've never dived in a dungeon with him, so I don't know how good he is.

"Okay, come at me"

"Yes, ......."

　The employee leaned forward and rushed forward at once.

　It is certainly a good move if you want to seize your opponent.

　But his movements are too linear and slow.

　I pull myself back from the tackle just in time and aim my hand at the back of his exposed neck.
　 I'm sure he didn't even realize what had happened.

　I moved the employee to the side so that he would not be caught in the middle of the situation, and then I looked at Suda again.

　Suda looked at me and gritted his teeth in frustration.

"I'm not going to let you get away with just a pay cut,......."

"Give it up already, Suda. This is all being streamed too. It's over for you and this company."

"I'm not going to let you get away with this! I won't let you ruin the company!　Hey, Gouda, get him!"

　Suda shouts, and a large man comes forward from among the employees.

　He is Masato Gouda, an explorer belonging to the Black Dog Guild.

　He stands 190 cm tall and has a muscular body. His hair is short and coiffed, and his face is stern.

　Unlike the young employee earlier, Gouda is a strong explorer with a Class A explorer's license. Suda also depends on Gouda.

"Gouda!　Kill him!

"......"

　Gouda silently stands in front of me.

　He's my junior, but we've been in the dungeon together many times. I'm sure it won't be as easy to beat him as it was earlier.


"Tanaka-san, you are finally quitting. I'm rooting for you.

"To ......?"

　Gouda congratulates me in a low, scary voice.

　What's going on?

"I've been thinking about it for a while. Tanaka-san is not the right person to be in this guild. You are the kind of person who should be fighting on a bigger stage."

"Oh, um, thank you?"(Tl: "Ah etto-, arigatou", but unlike your imagination, it's a tall muscular guy saying it (˘̩̩̩̩̩̩∩˘̩̩̩̩̩̩))

　When we dived in the dungeon together, I thought he didn't like me because he was quiet and didn't talk to me at all, but it seems he didn't.

　Gouda congratulated me with a look of heartfelt happiness. Naturally, Suda did not like his attitude,

Gouda," he said, " why are you wagging your tail at such a scum?"

"Tanaka-san is my senior who taught me the basics of being an explorer, and I can't possibly agree to such a request no matter how many times the president orders me to do so. Even if ...... I really attacked him, I would only get a backhanded blowback. I'm sure the president knows that, too."

"Ugh,......!"


　I don't think that's true. I think I could have a good match with Gouda.

"Tanaka-san. I'll stop the president. Please go."

"Really?　Thank you very much."

　I patted Gouda on the back and turned to leave the company.

　I can hear Suda's noisy voice from behind me, but I don't care.

　I can finally get rid of this company. The next moment I thought that, ...... suddenly the door to the company opens with a bang.

"Everyone stop, please. This is the Audit Department of the Operations Bureau of the Association. We have received a call."

　A group of people dressed in suits entered.

"The Operations Bureau of the Association, as they called themselves, is an internal department of the Ministry of Monster Control, in other words, a government organization. They must have received a report from a viewer who was streaming the video. Well, if you do something so spectacular, you're bound to get reported, right?"

"Ha-ha-ha!　The wind is blowing my way, Tanaka!　Government officials!　Catch that criminal!　He's the criminal who raised his hand against me!"(Tl: His level of delusion continues to surprise and amuse me ( ᐛ )و)

　Suda shouts happily.

　But the officials pass me by and grab Suda and take him into custody.

"Hee......?"

　Suda shouts in a crazy voice.

　While I was unable to comprehend the situation, a female official in a suit stood in front of Suda and said:

"Akihiro Suda, we are detaining you for violating the Labor Standards for Explorers and the Special Law for Awakened Persons."
