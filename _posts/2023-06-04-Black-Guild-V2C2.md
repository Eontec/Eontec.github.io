…

Adachi's document was quite detailed.

　It was full of illustrations of things I didn't know, such as how to operate an account, the most popular viewing times, streaming content suggestions, streaming trends, how to pick up comments, information on other famous streamers, and so on.


　I don't usually watch D-tube (I was too busy to watch it), so it was very helpful.
<!--more-->

　Adachi also gave me a drone for streaming as an added bonus. He said it was a discontinued model, but it was still quite usable. This is a big help, too.


"Hey, Tanaka."

"What?"


　When I looked at Adachi, I saw a flash of light and squinted my eyes.

　I wondered what on earth he had done to me, but it seemed that he had taken a picture of me with his phone. As Adachi manipulates his phone, he mutters, "Is this what it looks like?


"What the hell?"

"Well, just wait a minute. ...... okay."


　Adachi says, and shows me the side of his phone.

On it, there was my channel with the name "Makoto Tanaka Channel". The icon is the picture of me that he took a while ago.

　I look tired, and even after all that sleep, I still can't shake the feeling that I'm still a corporate employee.


"You can't stream immediately after creating an account. I made it yesterday just in case. You can start streaming tomorrow. I'll send you the ID and password for this account later."

"You're really talented, ....... I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me. How can I ever repay you?"


I asked as I munched on the steak that had been brought to me.

　

　　But Adachi didn't seem to mind at all.


"I'm not so down on myself that I'm going to take advantage of an unemployed person. I'm looking forward to seeing you in action, Tanaka. So don't worry about it and go ahead and do your best."

"I'm sorry, Adachi ....... I'm very grateful for your help."


　I put the materials in my bag and took a bite of the pancake tower that was left over and put it in my stomach.

　I'm about 70 percent full.


"I've been going along with the idea of becoming a streamer, but are you interested in joining another guild?　You were invited by lots of them in that stream".

"I'm going to start out as a free agent. I just want to test my ability, and I really liked the way people were cheering me on with their comments."

"I see. I'm glad to hear that", Adachi said happily.


　I checked the time, picked up my bag and stood up.


"I've got to go to the association's administration office and explain some things, so I'd better get out of here. Thanks for everything."

"Oh, I see. Will Kanade-chan be there?"


　Adachi asks with a grin.

　Kanade-chan is the section chief of the Subjugation Division 1, Kanade Amatsuki. I've known Amatsuki for a long time, so Amatsuki and Adachi know each other too.


"I saw Kanade for the first time in a long time on the stream, and she has become a beautiful woman. She was cute before, but I didn't expect her to become so beautiful. The commenters were very excited. I heard that she is now called the 『Ice Sword Princess』. There were so many comments saying they wanted to be abused, it made me laugh."

"Yeah. She's really grown up to be a great person, Unlike me. I'm sure she was disillusioned when she saw me."


　Amatsuki is not going to be able to come to the upcoming interrogation.



　I'm sure she doesn't want to see me in a bad spot, so that's fine with me.


"No, no, no, if she was disillusioned, she wouldn't have bothered to come to that place. You used to call each other "Makoto-nii" and "Kanade-chan", didn't you? It's not so easy to be disliked. On the contrary, I'm sure she still likes you ......."

"It's okay. It's just because I'm lame. I'm going to do my best from now on to at least get her to give me a second look."

"Ah,......, well, whatever. The future is very difficult for Kanade-chan."


　Adachi looks dumbfounded as he says things I don't understand.

　


"Well, anyway, I'll read this and start streaming tomorrow"

"I'll watch it while I work, so good luck."


　And with that, Adachi and I parted ways.




◇　◇　◇



　The next day around noon.

　I visited the "Nishi-Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon" in Nishi-Shinjuku.


　The dungeon was created by a crack in the earth, and only the middle level of the dungeon has been confirmed at present.

　I decided to start with this medium-sized dungeon because if I suddenly tried to do a fancy dungeon with a deep level, people might get bored of it soon.

　Adachi's material said that the power of buzz is great, but if it grows too fast, people will get bored with it too quickly. It's a scary industry.


　I'm going to fly a drone for streaming, sync it with my smartphone, and link it to my D-tube account."


　I started streaming while looking at the information given to me by Adachi.

　I started promoting it on social media, and Adachi immediately retweeted it, spreading the word.


　The number of viewers kept growing, and in no time at all, it reached 1,000.

　It's nerve-wracking to think that that many people are behind the camera.


「The Corporate Sword Saint has arrived!」

「I've been waiting for you!」

「Suda, he's been found guilty!」

「I've subscribed to your channel 10,000,000 times.」

「You look a little better, don't you?」

「I want to see the depths.」

「Divine Sword Saint!」

「Who's that?」

「What kind of battle are you going to show us today?」


　A flood of comments poured in.

　Thinking back, it was thanks to them that I was able to quit that company. To repay them for that, I have to do it seriously.
