Tl: Sam

"Hello everyone, I am Makoto Tanaka, an explorer formerly with the Black Dog Guild. Thank you for coming to my first stream today."


　I bow to the drone.

　I've heard that D-tubers get a more cheerful, carefree vibe, but I decided to do it in this polite, working-class manner. It's easier for me to be polite, and Adachi thinks it's funny.
<!--more-->

　Comments begin to flow.


「Hello!」

「Wow, it's real!　That's the real thing!」

「You're still in your business suit.」

「Good morning, Shachiken.」

「What's "Shachiken"?」

「Shachiken stands for 'corporate slave Sword Saint' right?」(Tl: Coporate slave(or company livestock lol)=社畜(Shachiku) Sword Saint=剣聖(Kensei))

「Where are you going to go today?」

「Are you going to be in the depths today?　I'm curious!」

「Tanaka!　Did you eat breakfast?」


"Thank you for all your comments. I think I will dive the West Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon today. I'll go to the middle or lower level, but I'll dive deeper another time. And I did eat breakfast, thank you for your concern."


　I respond, frantically following the comments that drift away in an instant.

　This is not easy. I wonder how the streamers of the world do this every day. I admire them.


Now that we are already near the site, I'd like to dive right in. Oh, I would appreciate it if you could promote it on social media. I'm unemployed at the moment.


　I start walking while making small talk like this.

　As the name suggests, the "Nishi-Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon," where we will dive today, is a dungeon in the middle of a huge cliff.

　The underground dungeon is located at the bottom of the cliff, so just getting there is a bit of a strenuous task.


　So the Dungeon Management Bureau recently built a sort of management elevator that allows you to go down to the bottom of the cliff.

　I went there, of course, but I couldn't get to the bottom of the cliff. ......


"Ah...... it's so crowded!"


　There was a long queue of many explorers there.

　I've been in this dungeon several times, but I've never seen a situation like this. Why in the world is this happening?　Did they find some rare item or monster?


　No, first of all, I have to think about what to do about today's stream. I definitely don't want it to be a washout from the very first shot.


「[Sad news] Today's dungeon attack, canceled.」

「Streaming incident right off the bat?」

「I was looking forward to it!」

「I knew the last stream was a composite. I was looking forward to it.」

「I've canceled the channel.」


　The comments were starting to get rough.

　This is not good. We have to do something. If I don't do something, the streaming incident will be summarized as a streaming incident from the very first shot. I've read and studied the material Adachi gave me, but this is just too much.


　I'll do something to fix it.


“Something seems to have happened. I'll ask someone"


　I tried to look nonchalant as I talked to the explorer who was nearby.

　I usually don't talk to strangers because I haven't done so recently, but thanks to the cameras rolling, I was able to talk to him.


"Excuse me, do you have a minute?"

"Um, ah, yes, ......,Eh, you're the Corporate Sword Saint!" (Tl: I think I'll stop adding the "Slave" part, but it lives on in our hearts)


　The young male explorer who spoke to me looked at me and let out a loud voice.

　The other explorers also reacted and looked at me.


　Ugh, the attention makes me sick to my stomach. ......


「You're a celebrity now, aren't you?」

「Guild recruitment coming?」

「I heard he has a lot of fans among the explorers.」

「Well, they would if they saw us fight like that. We only think "wow", but if you're an explorer, you know how great it is.」


　I take my gaze away from the comments and continue talking with the excited male explorer.


I look at him and say, "Hey, is there something wrong with the entrance?"

"Ah!　I'm sure you're planning to enter the West Cliff as well!　It's so lucky that I might be able to dive at the same time as a famous person!"


　The male explorer is talking happily.

　Is "West Cliff" short for "West Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon"?　Well, it's certainly long enough to call it by its official name, but I can't help but think it's too abbreviated.


"Um, the reason it's so crowded is ......"

"Oh, I'm sorry. I got excited. The reason why it is crowded, right? The elevator to the entrance seems to have broken down. It seems that some groups were able to go in the morning, but it broke down on the way. If this continues, it seems they can't even retrieve the people who have gotten down"

"I see. Thank you very much."


　Elevator malfunction, huh?

　That's why there are so many people here.


　Waiting for the machine to be fixed is not possible in terms of the stream. But going to a different dungeon is also not very exciting.

　The comments are starting to cool down: "Boring," "I don't have one," "Well, if it's broken, it can't be helped," and so on. It is inevitable that the number of subscribers to the channel will decrease if things continue as they are.


　I remember that the material given to me by Adachi had written about how to solve problems when they occur.

　Let's see, I think It says, "Solve problems by force, just like you used to do when you were a corporate slave. That's the most popular solution."


　I don't know if that really works, but I'll check it out.


"Staff, please check in as we enter the dungeon."

"Huh? Mr. Kensei-san!?"(Tl: Or is this better? It takes the corporate part out of the title, which I think really defeats the point, tell me in the comments)


　That's the second time today I've gotten that reaction.

　I guess they all know my face. It's hard to deal with .......


"Excuse me, the receptionist there"

"Oh, sorry. You can't go in there right now. ......"

"No problem, just checkng in."

"Okay......"


　Whenever you enter a dungeon, you need to apply to the staff of the Dungeon management bureau that manages the dungeon. If I was a member of a guild, the guild would take care of that for me.

　I'm a freelancer, so I don't get a face-pass.


".....Yes,  You can pass"

“Thank you."


　I thanked him and stood by the cliff.

　The cliff is so deep, I can't see the bottom at all.


「Wow. If I fall off, I'm sure I'll die.」

「 People who are afraid of heights die safely.」

「Are we breaking up today?」

「Is it too much to ask for the much-talked-about Kensei-sama?」


　Okay, then, let's follow Adachi's opinion and go in as usual.

　I squeeze my tie tightly to get into the mood and jump off the cliff.


「What?」

「What?」

「What?」

「Geeaaaah!」

「I'm dying, I'm dying!」

「Are you serious?」


　The comment section was a scene of screaming.

　Should I have told them I was going to jump?　But Adachi also said that we need an element of surprise, so I guess it's okay as long as it's lively.


"I'm going down now....."


　I twisted and controlled my body in the air and kicked the cliff wall, aiming for the bottom.


"You might get a little dizzy, so be careful."


　With that said, I descended to the bottom of the cliff.



...


Tl Note: Ah yes the "Flash Warning" in the middle of the video, there can't be any better way to do anything...
