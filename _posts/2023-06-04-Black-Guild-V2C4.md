Tl: Sam

…


「Kyaaaaaaa!!　I'm going to fall down!」

「I'm going to die!　I'm going to die!」

「I've fallen before. I'm already used to it.」

「Is this your first time streaming Shachiken?　Relax,」
<!--more-->

「No one's used to it.」

「I'm going to have to take a motion sickness pill.」

「This is really going to kill me!　I don't care how sturdy the awakened are, if they fall at this speed, they're going to die!」


　I confirm that the comments are flowing at a blazing speed while I'm falling.

　I don't know what it is, but they seem to be getting excited. Looks like I was right to jump in.


“Time to slow down."


　As the bottom gradually appears in sight, I pull out the single-edged sword at my waist.

　I thrust it into the cliff and put my foot on the back of the blade. It's like skateboarding in shape. But it's not snow that he's skating on, it's a cliff.


"Here goes ......!"


　After slowing down enough, I kick the cliff and jump up.

　Then, after spinning a few degrees in the air, I land with a thud. I'm used to this kind of acrobatic movement since I used to jump around in dungeons to fulfill endless quotas when I was a corporate slave.


「Muu, I'm dizzy .......」

「I thought I was going to die just looking at it.」

「It was so exciting!　I wish I could be an awakened person too, to be able to move around like this!」

「No, a normal awakened person can't move around like this.　If they could, there wouldn't be an elevator here.」

「*But only if you're Tanaka. I don't think it's like this for others.」


　The response to the comments has been positive.

　It was the right thing to do.


"Well, then, let's get right into the 'Nishi-Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon. There may be some things I wouldn't like to show you, but I hope you enjoy it."


「You're so fucking polite, Kusa.」

「You're soaked in company spirit.」

「But I like it because a lot of streamers are rude.」

「I get it. It makes me feel comfortable.」

「It's okay to be like this.」

「It's normal and it makes me feel safe.」

「Wait a minute. You forgot he just jumped off a cliff!　He's not normal!」


　I step into the dungeon with the comments behind me.

　There are exceptions, but basically, the dungeon continues underground. The walls are like caves, hollowed out of earth and rock, and some of them are like ruins.


　The most important feature is that there are monsters in the dungeon.

　Basically, monsters live only inside the dungeon, but occasionally some of them come out. In such cases, Amatsuki's office is contacted first, and the staff there goes to defeat the monsters.


　While I was thinking about that......, the monsters were on their way.


『Gigi, gigi .......』


　The green-skinned monsters, known as "goblins," came with a shrill voice.

　Although they use knives and other weapons, they are not intelligent or physically strong at all.

　They are ranked D by the Association of Explorers, which is the lowest danger level.


　There were five goblins in all.

　There weren't that many of them, and it didn't look like it would be a good time to take a picture of them.


"Yo!"


　I stepped lightly and passed by the goblins.

　A moment later, I swung my sword. The goblins were all in the same position.


『Gee……?』


　The goblins crumpled to the ground, not even realizing what had happened.

　They probably couldn't even catch sight of me with their eyes. Now, hurry up and go to the middle level and make the sights......


「What?　What did you just do?」

「I couldn't see you at all!」

「I'm a B-rank explorer and I really didn't see it. I'm losing confidence ......」

「The camera's performance is not good enough. I can't see it even if I view it frame by frame. When did he move?」

「This is a defeat of human technology, isn't it?」

「The camera can't see him?　I've got an idea.」

「Officer, this is the guy.」 (Tl: Oh my God I’m crying(*≧艸≦*))


　With a ding, I sheathe my sword, and the comments are very noisy.

　Apparently, they're getting excited about my current move.


　Hmmm. The opponent was a goblin, not an opponent that anyone would have a hard time against. People who aren't explorers are watching, but don't they know that what they've just seen isn't great?


"Um, I'm glad you're happy, but that was just a goblin, so it's no big deal. You can do that with a little practice."


　When I explained that, the comments flowed at blast speed.


「I can't do that!」

「I can take down a goblin too, but not like that. ......」

「 Are you saying I'm doing something wrong?」

「It's hard to know if you're serious or not.」

「Shachiken: "What? I just slashed him at a speed that even the camera can't follow." 」

「Tanaka!　There's a different monster coming!」


I noticed a large gray rat coming toward us.

　Is that a dungeon rat? It's about as strong as a goblin, but it's fast and above all, it stinks.


　If you get covered in its blood, you can't get rid of the rotten smell for a while. I used to have a hard time with them.


　The comments were coming.

「Ugh, it's a dungeon rat!」

「I don't like the smell.」

　And the like.


　It seems that everyone has the same thought.


"I'll tell you a good way to beat the dungeon rat. It's not that hard, and it won't stink.”


「Is there such a method?」

「I want to hear it, I want to hear it!」

「I hope so!」

「It's a lie, it's definitely difficult.」

「Don't say that, we already know」


　I look at the dungeon rat coming toward me and pull my sword out of its sheath at high speed.


　The sword flashes, and an invisible blade is released.


　It is a shockwave that occurs when the speed of sound is exceeded, a so-called high-speed shockwave. The blade, which I call the "flying blade," cuts the dungeon rat in two and blows its body away.

　This way, I won't get the stink on me.

　Now, what do you think of the reaction of the comments? I'm surprised that many people don't know how to do this.　I hope it helps.


「It's impossible after all!!」

「I knew it.」

「I knew it.」 

「I knew.」 

「You see...」

「Humans don't normally produce shockwaves.」(Tl: This one is my faavourite)

「He worked for a very special company.」

「It would be fun to shoot something like that.」

「Awakened people can do that?」

「How could they?」


　For some reason, this was a different reaction than I had expected.

　Hmmm, why doesn't it work like this? Should I change my approach?


　As I was thinking this, Adachi, as if he could see right through me, said, "That's good. Keep it up."

　I'm not sure, but if he says so, I'll keep going a little longer.


"Well, I'm going to go into the middle level now, and I have a question box on social media, so if you have any questions, please ask them there."


　I looked at the camera, which I was not used to doing, and went further into the dungeon.
