Tl: Sam

…

　After defeating the goblins and the dungeon rats, I went down and down through the upper levels.


　I was attacked by treants and kobolds along the way, but they were just monsters in the upper levels. After defeating them without any trouble, I reached the middle level.


"From here on down is the middle level. Monsters stronger than before will appear, so you need to be careful."
<!--more-->

　There is little difference in appearance between the upper and middle levels.

　Perhaps the walls and the ground are a little darker?　I guess so, but you have to look closely to notice it.


　The difference is the amount of "magic essence"

　"Magic essence" is an unknown substance that can awaken a person. The deeper you go in the dungeon, the higher the concentration of magic essence in the air.


"In the middle level, there are some people who get magic essence intoxicated, so please be careful if you come to the dungeon. If you get into your body too much at once, you may get intoxicated."


　It used to be common for people to suddenly descend to the lower levels and die from magic essence poisoning.

　Just like climbing a mountain, it is important to get used to the environment slowly.


「But didn't Shachiken dive deep down at once the other day?」

「Indeed.」

「Oh, by the way, I saw that in the clipping.」

「What was that about?」

「I don't know, he's not very convincing.」

「I'm sure he's got full immunity to it or something.」

「It's scary because it seems so plausible.」


　......I certainly did that.

　I'll give you my defense of that.


"Well, ...... I certainly have a resistance to magic essence, so I can dive deep at once. But if a normal person did it, their body would probably explode, so please don't do it."


「You're going to explode?」

「That's scary!」

「Magic essence is too serious!」

「Ow!」

「See, I knew you were resistant to it!」

「The ultimate perfect Shachiken!」

「Why do you have resistance?　I get magic essence sickness easily, so I really want to know.」

「Sure, I'd like to know too.」


　As I looked at the comments, here and there people started to say they wanted to be resistant too.

　There are no monsters yet, but I'm not sure if it's safe to answer the question.


"Basically, the longer you stay in the dungeon, the more your body becomes accustomed to the magic essence. When you've been in the dungeon as long as I have,......, I'd say about 10 years of doing 350 hours of overtime a month. If you spend that much time in the dungeon, I'm sure you'll naturally develop a tolerance."


「It's just too much work.」

「Fueeeeee!」

「 I feel like I'm going to throw up just listening to this.」

「Suda!　Don't you ever come out here again!」

「My favorite streamer is too much of a corporate livestock, it's tough!」

「I have to choose between being a company animal or getting magic essence drunk. ......」


　The confused comments flowed.

　Well, I don't like it either. I wouldn't want to go back to that life either.


"Oh, and you can build up a tolerance by eating things in the dungeon."


　I said and picked up a mushroom growing nearby.

　The name of this mushroom, glowing blue-white, is "Luminous Cap". Of course, it is a special mushroom that can only be found in dungeons.

　This mushroom is filled with magic essence. If you eat it, you will be inoculated with magic essence.


"Itadakimasu!"


　I eat the mushroom raw.

　I eat the mushroom raw. The texture is a little unpleasant, but the taste is not bad.


「You're eating raw grass, no, mushrooms.」

「Ooooh!」

「Didn't your mother teach you not to eat shiny things!」

「There's almost nothing on earth that glows in the first place.」

「I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything in the dungeon!　I thought I heard on the news that people were hospitalized because of it.」

「Wait. Even if the mushrooms are safe to eat, you shouldn't eat them raw.」


　The comments section was abuzz.

　I feel like I'm being pulled in a big way.


"Ah, but if you're going to eat them, it's better to do it a little at a time. If you take in magic essence too quickly, you will get addicted. In my case, my quota was so tight that I didn't even have time to eat, so I just ate the dungeon food raw and at random. ......"


　In the beginning, I had a stomachache and collapsed.

　But after three years of working, I could eat raw and not get sick to my stomach. Human adaptability is not foolproof.


「So that's how you took in the magic essence.」

「They say the more magic essence you take in, the stronger you become, so that's how you became stronger.」

「I caught a glimpse of the secret of Shachiken's strength. ......」

「That's why he's so strong. I can't imitate him.」

「You'd die if you tried.」

「I went to the lower level for a little while the other day, but I got sick in five minutes.」

「I pity you. ......」

「［\5000］ Too pitiful. Here, have a nice meal.」

「Oh?」

「Oh?　I can send Super Chats now?」


　As I looked at the comments, I was struck by a notation I had never seen before.

　This is ...... I'm pretty sure it was written in the material Adachi gave me.


　Was the name "Superchat"?　It says it's also called a throwaway. (Tl: Reasonably so)

　It was said that viewers could send money directly to the streamer. I didn't think anyone would use such a feature, but it really works.


　Oops, first of all, I have to say thank you.


"Thank you very much for the Super chat. Now I'll have something delicious to eat. It seems that the function of Super Chat has been unlocked. This is thanks to everybody here. Thank you."


　Saying that, I bowed deeply.

　I didn't want to bow to Suda, but it wouldn't be so bad if it was to the viewers.


　By the way, the Super Chat function will be unlocked when the number of subscribers to the channel exceeds 10,000.

　The number was exceeded in the last stream, but it seems that the restriction cannot be lifted immediately after the number is exceeded, and will be lifted after various identities are confirmed to be clean.


　The timing was right now.


「［\2000］I can finally throw money!　I'll give you a severance package!」

「［\10000］I'm a fan!　I'm looking forward to more streams!」

「［\500］It's not much, but it'll help with your lunch!」

「［\15000］Here's a retirement gift from me too!」

「［\8000］You guys are so naive, you should be more careful with your money.」

「［\3000］This is a very friendly internet space.」


　Superchats flow one after another.

　Seeing this, I felt my eyes burning and held them down.


　What is it? I feel like all the hard work I've put in up until now has paid off.

　This is the first time I've been treated so well by so many people. I'm so glad I quit my job and became a streamer.


「Mr. Tanaka!　Are you okay!」

「Shachiken, man, you're crying.」

「You know, when you get older, your tear glands get looser. I can tell.」

「Haha, the crying part is sexy too ......」

「Oh, man, that's some badass shit.」


　I wipe my tears and hold them back.

　I have to make sure I finish.


"Thank you. I will continue to stream the site with all my heart and soul so that I can live up to your expectations. Thank you for your continued support."


「You're so formal, it's embarrassing for me.」

「Thank you very much.」

「Don't be so hard on yourself, take care of yourself!」

「Oh, I think I might like this stream too much.」

「The guy who made other dungeon streams a thing of the past.」

「I'll get a part-time job and spach!」(Tl: Super chat, but I'm leaving it like that)


　Receiving warm words, I proceed through the middle level.

　I guess it's time for some monsters to appear. I want to defeat it in some awesome way to live up to everyone's expectations,...... while I’m thinking this, a voice that sounds like a scream suddenly enters my ears.


"...... this is!"


　A high-pitched, female voice.

　It is clearly coming from below.


「Eh,  an incident?」

「Isn't this bad?」

「But this dungeon is sealed off right now, right?」

「Didn't the guy before say a couple of people went in there in the morning?　Before the elevator broke down.」

「Oh, I think he did.」

「Wha!? The video is messed up!?」


　The next thing I knew I was running out.

　I don't mean to sound righteous, but I'd like to help if I can, as far as I can see.


"The movie is a little bumpy. Please take anti-dizzy medicine if you don't like it."(Tl: anti-dizzy medicine lol)
