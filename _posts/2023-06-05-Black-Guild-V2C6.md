Tl: Sam

…

「This is so fast. He's already a human bullet train.」

「Isn't this faster than a bullet train?」

「Oh, no, I'm getting sick again.」

「You have to take motion sickness medicine.」
<!--more-->

「I took some anti-nausea pills and I'm really starting to feel better.」

「Well, I'm going to take some too. ......」

「I'm not sure how the drone can keep up with this speed. I'm sure it's a good model.」

「I think the drone is going to die of exhaustion.」

「Don't die Drone-kun (´；ω；｀)」


　I run through the dungeon without checking the comments flowing.

　Of course, while running, I also keep an eye on my surroundings.


"Something's not right. ......"


　I can't express it well, but there was a strange feeling in the dungeon.

　The atmosphere is unsettling. The monsters that I saw seemed to be in some kind of a frenzy.


　In this kind of situation, unexpected troubles are likely to occur. I have to be careful.


"I can see it now ......!"


　Ahead of my gaze, I see the figure of an explorer who is fighting.

　That person was a young female searcher. Wielding a large sword as tall as she is, she is fighting monsters.


"She is diving alone?　That's dangerous. ......"


「Um, the mirror .......」

「The guy who went deep alone is saying something.」 (Tl: This comment section is golden)

「Well, this guy is special. ......」

「*He worked for a very special company.」

「Actually, solo dives below the middle tier are dangerous. It's suicide.」

「I remember there was a bill that was going to make licensing a requirement for soloing. I wonder what happened to that.」


　I've been pushed into it, but I don't care,

　In my case, I was just forced to go solo by the company. I didn't like doing it.


　You may go to the upper levels, but you shouldn't go to the middle or lower levels alone. Dungeons are full of traps and other dangers as well as monsters. Two or more people can help each other, but with just one person, one mistake can lead to death.


　A dungeon is a place like a game, but if you die, it ends there.

　You can't play it again.


"Go away please ......!"


　I hear the voice of a woman being attacked by a monster.

　She is a pretty woman with shoulder-length chestnut hair. She is about the age of a college student?　She is quite young among the explorers.


　Her movements are not bad, but her opponent is not.

　She is dealing with an "ogre". It is a demon-type monster with horns.


　In addition to its high intelligence, it is a monster that boasts considerable monstrous strength, making it a rather troublesome opponent.

　In addition, there are ten ogres, and they are slowly weakening her as they surround her in team play. There's no way she can run away from that thing.


「That's an ogre, isn't it?」

「What, why are there ogres here!」

「Hmm?　What's wrong?」

「Ogres are monsters that live below the lower levels.」

「But we're in the middle level, right?」

「Is there something unusual going on?　Is it bad?」


　The commenters begin to fuss.

　Abnormal situations, as the name implies, are things that don't usually happen in dungeons. Monsters that normally do not appear in the dungeon appear in large numbers, for example.


"Kyaa!?"

　She was fighting hard but was unable to catch the ogre's club and dropped her greatsword.

　The ogre reached


　Oh no. I have to hurry.


"---- haa!"


　I kick the ground ten times in an instant and accelerate quickly.

　Then I pull out my sword and slice through the body of the ogre that was reaching for me.


『Gii……？』



　The ogre collapses, not knowing what just happened.

　I walk past it and take the woman who was being attacked in my arms and move away from the ogre and his followers.


　I'm holding her like a princess, so her buttocks and various soft parts are hitting me, but it's ...... an emergency situation, so I hope you'll forgive me. I'm not going to get sued, am I? 


"Um,...... are you all right?"

"Uh, ah, hiya."


　The woman who rolled her eyes in surprise in my arms replied.
