Tl: Sam

…

"Can you stand up?"

"Yes, I can. I'm fine. ......"


　I gently lower the woman in my arms.

　Her clothes are frayed here and there, and there are small scratches on her body.


"My name is Makoto Tanaka. And you are?
<!--more-->

"Tanaka-san, that corporate slave Kensei-san?　I'm not surprised. I'm Hoshino Yui. I am a dungeon streamer."


　A cracked and smoking drone was flying unsteadily near her as she introduced herself as Hoshino. It seemed to have been destroyed by an ogre.


　I was surprised that my name is known even to this girl I met by chance. It seems that the name of "The Coporate Slave Sword Saint” is spreading more than I thought it would. The power of the Internet is amazing.


「This girl is from Yui Channel, isn't she?」

「She got a lot of buzz recently for 『too cute explorer,』 didn't she?」

「Yui is cute. I'm going to subscribe to her channel.」

「Oh, by the way, I heard on social networking sites that the stream suddenly went dead.」

「I didn't expect a collaboration.」

「I've notified the Dungeon management about the unusual situation, but do you think they'll act?」

「I don't think they'll go so far as to rescue the explorers」


　I glance at the comments to understand the current situation.

　It's great that you've notified the Dungeon Office. But as the comment says, they won't come to our rescue. Everything that happens inside is the explorer's own responsibility. If you don't like it, you have to join a company.

　Well, the guild I was in wouldn't have come to our rescue.


“How did you get into this situation?"

"That's ...... I don't know either. I was streaming in the shallow middle level, and suddenly an ogre attacked me ....... I've never been to the lower levels, so I ran for my life, but I was driven lower and lower, and there was nothing I could do."


　Tears came to Hoshino's eyes.

　I guess she remembered the time when she was chased and got scared. I used to feel fear too when I first started diving in dungeons, so I know how she feels.


　I put my hand on her trembling shoulder and encouraged her.


"You did your best, didn't you? You can rest assured now. It's ---- my business from here."


　I switch my mind from the outgoing respectful mode to the business mode.

　The opponent is ten ogres. Compared to the battles in the deeper levels, they are boring opponents, but that's okay. I was just bored from dealing with the monsters in the upper levels that I usually ignore.


　I take one step closer to the ogres.

　The ogres take a step back from me.


『Gu, u......!』

"What, are you running away?"


　As I said this as if to provoke them, the ogres seemed to have made up their minds, gripping their weapons tightly and roaring, 『GAAAAAAHHHHH!』 They roar.

　Then they all charge toward me at once.


「Gyaaaaah!」

「Ogre, that's scary!」

「Oooooooooooo, it's dead.」

「Well, you'll just have to watch, at first glance. Our coporate slaves are amazing」

「Clipping team, please.」

「［\10000］Tanaka-san!　Please do it!」


　I focus all of my thoughts on the enemy in front of me and step in.


『Ga......?』


　The ogre lets out a stunned sound when he sees me appear in front of him in an instant.

　Before his face can change to surprise, I draw my sword and slash the ogre in half.


I pull out my sword and slash the ogre in half.


　A large amount of magic essence splatters from the wound, and the ogre crumples to the ground.

　The ogres, realizing that one of their own had been killed, grabbed their clubs and attacked me as if to surround me.


『Gaaaa！』

"...... too late."


　I jumped up on the spot and ducked the ogre's attack, then spun around in mid-air and launched a spinning kick into the neck of the ogre that was behind me.

　The ogre's cervical vertebrae are completely destroyed with a nasty sound of bones being shattered.


　I kicked the ogre's body and accelerated in mid-air, and I slashed down one after another with a single blow at those who stiffened, not understanding what had happened.


「Yabbah. I've seen it in clippings before, but it's so much more powerful live.」

「This is it!　This is what I've always wanted to see!」

「I really hope you join our guild ......」

「I don't think Shachiken is the kind of guy who fits into a guild.」

「I used to be anti, but I'm converting. This is the real deal......」 (Tl: New religion?)

「I look at Ogre as a pissed-off boss. I want to graduate from being a corporate employee too.」

「He’s a star in the company worker world.」

「Look at Yui's face when she's looking at Shachiken. She's got the face of a female.」

「My Yui is ......」

「Well, it's no wonder she's attracted to strong men.」

「I looked in the mirror and saw a female face too. Maybe I'm a woman too.」

「That's funny, I'm a woman too.」

「All the viewers are going to turn into females ......(´；ω；｀).」


　The ogres fell one after another.

　Before I knew it, there was only one left.


『Guh, guh ......!』


　The ogre didn't run away and held up the club in his hand, even though he knew the difference in strength.

　He seemed to be proud to be a warrior.


"I understand. I'll give it my all."


　I sheathed my sword and assumed an iai stance.

　Then the ogre took advantage of the opportunity and attacked.


　He may see this as an opening, as I have my sword sheathed. But when you take this stance, it is as if you have a gun pressed to their forehead.

　All you have to do is pull the trigger and the game is won.


“――――Tanaka style swordsmanship 『Blink』.”


　There is a flash of light, and my body and the Ogre's pass each other in an instant.

　The ogre doesn't know what happened, turns around and tries to come toward me, but after about three steps, his torso is cut in two and he crumples to the ground.


　『Blink』 is the fastest Iaijutsu, so fast that he doesn't even notice he's been cut.


"You were strong too, but you had the wrong opponent."


I put the sword back into its scabbard completely and started walking towards Hoshino-san.

Tl Note: I managed another chapter yayyyy.......
