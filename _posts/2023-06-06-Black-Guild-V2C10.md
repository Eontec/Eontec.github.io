“I'm sorry for cuting off the stream so abruptly. Now I am going to escape from the West Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon, where something unusual is happening, with Hoshino-san."
<!--more-->


「We're going to start as if nothing happened, lmao.」

「I won't leave you alone. ......」

「Holy shit, it's back on ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━!」

「I'm sure everyone remembers all that.」

「Streaming resumed (after two minutes).」

「What did you do in those two minutes?　I'm curious!」

「Young men and women, nothing happened. ......」

「I've taken off my clothes for now!　What should I do next?」


　Ignoring the comments section, which as usual likes to talk about the juicy stuff, I start to return to the dungeon with Hoshino.

　It would be quickest if I could return home while smashing through the ceiling, but Hoshino wouldn't be able to keep up with me if I made such a move. Inevitably, it would take longer than it did on the way there.


"Are you okay?　Can you run on your own two feet?"

"Ha, ha, yes!　I'm totally fine!"


　Hoshino smiles brightly, as if she is fine.

　As a power fighter, she is not the fastest person on her feet. I have to be careful not to fly too fast.


"By the way, why don't you party with others, Hoshino?　Even if you don't join a guild, I don't think you'd be in danger in the middle tier if you're with someone else."

"Ahh, ....... I often get invitations to collaborate with people, but the only people who approach me are men with kind of scary eyes. ......"

"I see. ......"


　Scary eyes, in other words, are probably the guys who are 'aiming' at Hoshino.

　The stream is a building block, and the real deal comes afterwards. The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help.


　At first glance, she seems natural and easily fooled.

　If a natural and extraordinarily cute girl was streaming alone, she would be targeted by hungry streamers.

　It's amazing that she hasn't been targeted yet.


"So I'll be your first collaborator?"

"Yes, you are!"

"Haha, I'm kind of sorry. I'm sorry that this old man is your first collaborator."

"No, it's not like that!　I'm really happy that my first person is Tanaka-san!" (TL: Comments are going to love this)


　After Hoshino said that, she realized she had said something outrageous and blushed, " Ah". Naturally, the comments section is abuzz.


「Yes, we got 'first timer'.」

「She's too natural, isn't she? ......」

「You're just in time for the Shachiken, aren't you?」

「I'm so glad you're my first. That's the line I want to hear the most..」

「 Uncle, you're making my heart flutter.」

「I'm having heart palpitations.」

「They've had sex!」

「This girl is too cute. I want to promote you, so please come back alive. ......」　


　I'll leave the comments alone because I can't seem to stop them no matter what I say.

　Huh, there's no way this cute girl is going to be attracted to me. The viewers should look at reality a little.


"Um, I'm sorry. I ......"

"I don't mind. It's okay, the audience seems to be having fun."

"Well, I meant what I said before, ......."

"----?"


　I heard a sound and stopped.

　 Hoshino also stopped, panicking.


"What's going on?"

"Shh. I hear someone's voice."

"What?　I don't hear anything ......"

"it's over there."


　I listened carefully and determined the direction of the sound.

　There was no doubt. This is a human voice. And I also hear what sounds like a battle going on.


「Yeah, I didn't hear anything.」

「I blasted up the sound on the video, but I can't hear it.」

「I'm sure drones nowadays have pretty sophisticated microphones on them. ......」

「Shachidken`s ears must be even more powerful than that.」

「*He worked for a very special company.」

「Tanaka’s Ears are from hell」.

「I turned up the sound to the limit in my software and there really was a faint human voice. Why can’t I hear it?」

「Why are there people here?」

「Well, they said there were a couple of explorers in there this morning, so that must be it.」

「...... Isn’t this bad?　There's something unusual going on right now.」


　If the commenters are right and those explorers are being attacked by strong monsters, it's a bad situation. We should go help them right now.

　But we can't leave Hoshino alone either. As I was wondering what to do, Hoshino tugged on my sleeve.


"Let's go, Tanaka-san," she said. I can't just go home and leave the others alone!"

"But ......"

"I'm sure I can handle it!　I'm sure I won't pull you back. So please."


　Hoshino looks straight at me with a gaze filled with a strong will.

　It's a very different thing from me with dead fish eyes. I'd be the bad guy if I refused her request.


"Just run away if it's dangerous, okay?

"Yes, I will!　Thank you very much!"


　The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're getting into.

　The ship has come this far. We'll save everyone and get back on the ground.


"Let's go then. Follow me!"

"Okay!"


　Hoshino and I ran toward the voice as fast as we could.

　It took us only a few minutes to see the owner of the voice.


　There they were, a party of five explorers. They were fighting a nasty monster called a labyrinth magician.

　The Labyrinth Magician is a monster that looks like a black mist wearing a robe. It has a staff in its hand from which it unleashes a variety of magical attacks.


　The fog-like part is not solid and can be easily defeated by cutting or burning the robe, but it is a difficult opponent because of the variety of magic it uses.


　These monsters are from the lower levels, but they seem to have appeared here because of the unusual situation.

　The explorers seem to be in danger. We have to hurry and save them.


"For the second time today, it's time for ---- business."


　I switched to business mode and cut my way through the monsters at once.
