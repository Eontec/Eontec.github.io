"Hello everyone. It is Makoto Tanaka. This stream continues to be brought to you from inside the 'West Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon.'"     

「Huh?　You resumed streaming?」    
「Thank goodness!　You are safe!」     
「Tanaka!　You're alive!」     
「Oh, my God, they're streaming again!」     
「Shachiken, I believed in you!」     <!--more-->
「The title is “Tanaka's Labyrinth Cooking Course", is there some kind of mistake?」     
「There's Yui in the back, isn't there?　I'm glad you two are okay!」     

"We have now moved to a new location and are somewhere in the depths. The concentration of magic essence is high here, and Hoshino-san, who is not accustomed to the deeper levels, is one step away from magic essence intoxication. I'm sure you've all had similar experiences."     

「Of course not!」     
「There aren't even 10% of all explorers who can go to the deeper levels. ......」    
「When dungeons first appeared, there were a lot of people who got magic essence intoxication, but now you don't hear much about it.」     
「Humans must have evolved.」     
「The percentage of people who have awakened has also increased.」    
「What are you going to do about it, Yu-chan?　You can't cure magic essence intoxication, right?」     
「That's right. The only way is to wait for the magic essence to be expelled naturally.」      
「But in the deeper levels, the amount of magic element entering the body is greater than the amount being discharged, right? That's no good.」     
「Then aren't you stuck?」    

"...... It's true that even if you take a normal break, Hoshino-san's condition won't get better. I used to crawl back to the lower level when I got magic essence intoxication, as if I was going to die."     

「Why did you continue to work under such circumstances?」     
「Tanaka has a sad past: ......」      
「Fighting monsters in the depths alone while suffering from magic essence intoxication is too much.」     
「I wonder if there's any footage of that?」     
「I don't think so, the Black Dog Guild's account has disappeared.」     
「The guild itself went under. Maybe there is some data in the confiscated items.」     

"It won't heal even if you do it normally, so ...... I'm going to start cooking now. First, I'll prepare a large pot and boil some water."     

「 The cooking has started lmao」     
「 I really thought he mis-titled the stream!」     
「Thank God for the cooking stream. I was just out of it.」      
「New show Mako's Kitchen.」     
「I don't even know what that means.」     
「I can't tell if it's a joke or not.」         
「Tanaka! Don't cut your hands!」       
「It's normal with him that a pot comes out of a business bag and it's lol. Naturally, it also has a special ability.」      
 

　I fill the pot with water and put it on fire.    
　By the way, the magic essence stove I'm using is an item that produces a special flame using magic essence as energy.     
　This way, I don't have to worry about running out of fuel in the dungeon, and more importantly, I don't run out of oxygen, even in an enclosed space like a cave.     

　It is the perfect item for cooking in the dungeon.     

" Tanaka-san, please let me help you."    
"Are you all right?　You don't have to strain yourself."     
"I'm fine if it's just a little. I want to help, too."    
"...... got it. Then can you cut this into bite-sized pieces?”    

　I said and handed the food to Hoshino.    
　Hoshino received it and let out a frightened cry. Hoshino received it and let out a frightened cry.    

"What is this?"    
"Oh, it's a mushroom called drain mushroom. Don't you know it?"    
 
　I handed her a black, poisonous looking mushroom.    
　It's not poisonous, so you don't have to be afraid of it.     

「You're so freaked out!」    
「Poor thing is so cute.」    
「Yui, you look so cute with teary eyes」    
「This mushroom looks like a monster.」    
「Yui, are you afraid of mushrooms?　Uncle's mushrooms are ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊」     
「I've called the police.」     
「Seriously, perverts are not allowed.」     

"I don't know!　What are these mushrooms?"      
"This mushroom is a little special. It absorbs the magic essence of those who touch it. If eaten in moderation, it can alleviate the symptoms of magic essence intoxication."     
"I didn't know there was such an ingredient. ......"     

　Hoshino looked at the mushrooms she handed over to him sullenly.      
 
"But how did you know about that?　That kind of information shouldn't be known yet."        
"I told you in the stream today, I didn't have time and money to eat properly, so I used to eat things in the dungeon. When I ate these mushrooms, the symptoms of magic essence intoxication did not appear."          
"I see."     

　When I said that, for some reason, both Hoshino and the commenters were taken aback.    
　Am I that crazy?　It's true that it looks bad, but it doesn't taste that bad.    

"There are other herbs that promote the release of magic essence and vegetables that reduce the amount of magic essence taken in. If you eat these, your symptoms should improve."     
"Ha ha ha ...... thank you, thank you very much ......"       

「Yui is making a funny face.」     
「The ingredients in the pot, all of the ingredients I've never seen before, too scary.」     
「The dark pot is on a cute level.」     
「Is this the dungeon food I've heard so much about?」      
「If I had to choose between eating this or dying, I honestly don't know what I would do.」      
「I could end up eating it and dying.」    

"It's nostalgic. In the old days, I used to eat a lot of food with high magic essence content, and when I started to get intoxicated, I would eat something that would remove the magic essence intoxication and repeat the process to increase my tolerance to it."    

「You've just come out with a bad idea.」    
「If you take in that much magic essence, that's how you become strong.
No one can imitate this kind of thing.」      
「You're doing the same thing as the poisoner!」     

　Remembering the past, I stir the pot.    
　There is meat in the pot, but it is also the meat of a wild boar-type monster called a 『dungeon boar』. The meat contains a lot of magic essence, but if you drain the blood properly, the magic essence will be removed.     
　Other people don't know about it because they don't eat it, but it is an excellent meat because it contains a lot of strong meaty flavor.      

"By the way, you shouldn't eat shiny things like this because they contain a lot of magic essence."     
   
　I said as I showed them a glowing mushroom called "Luminous Cap”.          
　It would be a bad idea for to imitate this and get magic essence intoxication.      

「No one will eat them, so don't worry.」       
「Basically, we don't eat shiny things.」     
「Oh, he ate it raw.」      
「What the hell is going on with this guy's stomach?」     
「Let's stop using common sense to measure .......」     

"......Yeah, it's getting nice and cooked. All that's left to do is to add a little salt from the dungeon,...... and."     

　The seasoning is simple because the ingredients have a lot of flavor.     
　When the cooking is complete, I take the plate out of the bag and serve the soup.     
 
"It's a 'special magic essence-free soup. Can you drink it?"    
"Yes. ......"     

　Hoshino accepted the plate with some hesitation.     
　Then, after a few hesitant gestures, she scooped it up with a spoon and put it in her mouth.     

「Ah! You really ate it!」    
「You're very brave.」    
「Tanaka!　Where's my portion?」     
「I wouldn't eat it even if you served it to me.」    
「But it looks surprisingly delicious. ......」    

　Hoshino gulped down a mouthful of soup.     
　Then, she made a surprised expression on her face.     

“Oh, it's delicious......!"      
“I see. Good."     

「No way!　It's really delicious!」    
「That smile doesn't lie, does it?」    
「If Yui says so, I might want to try some. ......」     
「I mean, it's a basic rule that you're not supposed to eat anything from the dungeon, so this stream is a very valuable resource, isn't it?」     
「I think all of Shachiken's streams are valuable resources to begin with, aren't they?」     
「There are very few explorers who can go deep into the depths who are streaming.」      
「Yui is too cute eating. I want to protect this smile. ......」      
「There is Shachiken here, so you're not needed」     
「But it's starting to look more and more delicious. ......」     
「Yui, you look like you're going to enjoy the food.」      
「I'm getting hungry too.」     
「That's funny, it's supposed to be a dungeon's incomprehensible food. ......」    

　Hoshino takes a second and third bite of the soup.    
　I was a little nervous because it was the first time I'd made it for someone, but it looks like I made it safely and deliciously.    

"My body is getting warmer and warmer, and I feel less queasy!"    
　The magic essence has been drained from my body. If you eat too much, you'll lose too much this time."    
"Yes, I will!　I understand!"    
 
　Saying that, Hoshino started to eat the soup.     
　Hoshino's complexion improved rapidly. I'm sure she'll be ready to go after a little rest.
