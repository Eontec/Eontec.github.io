…

"Thanks for the food!"


　Hoshino said with a big smile on her face after finishing all the soup.

　For an awakened person, magic essence is an important substance. I was worried that it would be dangerous if all the magic essence was drained from the soup, but it seems that Hoshino's physical condition is fine.

　It seems that her body had accumulated more magic essence than I had imagined. The fact that she was fine after accumulating that much means that she has a large tolerance.

　Her fighting style was still rough, but she could be a great explorer if she trained herself.

　After finishing cleaning up the meal, I talked to her, intrigued by her talent.


"Hoshino ever learn how to fight from anyone?"

"No, I have never learned from anyone. I've only been in the dungeon a few times with other explorers to begin with. ......"

"Just a few times? Have you already estranged yourself from those people?"

"Well,...... they were a mixed party of men and women,...... and for some reason things got nasty when I entered. I was angry with one of the women who said, 'It's all messed up because you came in!' so I left to escape."


　Hoshino tells the story with sad eyes.

　She doesn't seem to realize it, but I can only imagine what happened.


 「Oh.」

 「Party crasher Hoshino.」

 「The princess of otaku」

 「If a cute girl like her comes over, of course I'm going to like her.」

 「It's hard not to have bad intentions.」

 「It's a good thing she left.」

 「I can imagine the ladies getting more and more upset because of all the guys giving Yui all the attention.」

 「Yui's so sweet, I bet the guys think 'this girl likes me'.」

""


　It's running through the comments, but it's probably something like this.

　She's kind, caring and open. It's no wonder you'd think she has a thing for you.


　I wouldn't be mistaken because I'm too old and there's no way she'd like such a dead-eyed corporate animal in the first place, but if she were a little closer to me, I'd have been mistaken.

　But I'm the adult here, so I should tell her off so that there won't be any more victims.


"I'm not sure what to say.　Men are creatures that fall in love with people who are ...... kind to them. Especially when they are touched by a cute girl like Hoshino. It's an instant kill move."

"Eh?　Cute ......?


Hoshino's face turns red. What happened to her?


"Ah, um, Do you think I'm cute ......?"

“What?　That's right. There aren't many girls that are as cute as Hoshino. If we were in the same class, I would have liked you for sure".

"Oh, wow."


 「Yui, your face is so red and cute.」

 「This company animal, you're attacking too fast, aren't you?」

 「She have low self-esteem, so she can't resist praise from others.」

 「Yui's face is so cute and squishy.」

 「I love the way they’re holding hands. Cute.」

 「Are you sure they're not dating?」

 「On the contrary, they only met today: ......」

 「I heard that if you become a corporate slave, you can get a cute girl. I'm going to join the Black Dog Guild.」

 「I've already joined the Black Dog Guild. I heard all the employees ran away.」

 「I'll only get sick if I join the Black Dog Guild.」


　The comments were noisy, but I ignored them. They're probably having another silly argument.

　As I was thinking that, Hoshino opened her mouth as if she had made up her mind.


"Then,......,Um ...... Tanaka, will you like me too,.........? "


 「Holy confession,━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！」

 「Bold confession is a girl's prerogative.」

 「Is this the venue for today's festival?」

 「I was a fan of Yui, but ...... I congratulate you, ...... ugh.」

 「Tanaka!　Show us your manhood!」

 「Uncle, my heart is pulsating. Is it heart palpitations?」

 「I'm going to the hospital.」

 「I threw up sugar.」

 「Yui, you're too cute.」

 「I puked my ****.」

 「What will you say?　What's he going to say?」

 「Don't underestimate the king of insensitivity, Tanaka. He won't notice it anyway.」

 「What? That's not true. ......, right?」


"Haha, you say funny things, Hoshino. Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?" (Tl: The sacred techniques)

"Oh. Uh, ...... I'm sorry, ......."


 「Gyaaaaahhh!」

 「He did it!　Seriously, that son of a bitch!」

 「Gross!」

 「Too dense.....」

 「He drank the sugar I threw up.」

 「YUI-CHIAN, you're so cute!」

 「You're so cute even when you're down.」

 「I called the police.」

 「Even the insensitive Tanaka noticed it. There was a time when I thought so too.」


　I try to keep my composure and say to Hoshino, "Be careful, okay?" I say to Hoshino.

　But in my heart, it was pretty dangerous. One more push and I might have lost my heart to the party crusher.

　Hoshino, you horrible girl. ......


"Let's get back to the story. You said Hoshino hasn't been taught how to fight, right?　That's such a waste. Hoshino has talent. If you don't learn how to fight with it, it will be a waste of treasure."

"I have a talent?"


　Hoshino tilts her head with a puzzled look.

　She's so cute with every move she makes.


"If you are a pure power fighter, I think you have more talent than I do. But it's not enough as it is. In order to teach you what you lack, first try slashing at me with that sword with all your might."

"What?　I can't slash at you, Tanaka-san!

"It's all right, you see. Trust me."

"Trust, huh? I understand. ......"


 「Yui, you're so determined!」

 「You trust him too much!」

 「Well, I'm sure Shachiken will be fine.」

 「Even if the worst happens, I'm sure Shachiken will be fine.」

 「I know.」


　Hoshino swung her sword as hard as she could and swung it down at ...... me.

　I catch the big swing with one hand from the front.


　Then, with a "gakki-gakku" sound, Hoshino's sword swings at me!


"Eh!?"


　Hoshino, not expecting to be stopped like this, rolls her eyes in surprise. She was surprised.　The comments were also excited: "Really?”


Hoshino has the power, but her core is not in sync with her power. If she can fix that, she will become even stronger.
