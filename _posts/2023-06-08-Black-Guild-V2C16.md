Tl: Sam

…

"The core?"


　Hoshino tilts her head at my words.

　It seems she doesn't understand what I'm talking about.


"Ah, When you swing a sword, you are putting all your strength into your arms, so your body is shaky. You need to stand up straight and swing the sword properly."
<!--more-->

"I see. So it's not like a "whoosh," but more like a "wham"?"

"Well, something like that."


 「 That's how it feels, isn't it?」

 「Is that how you get the message?」

 「Yui, you look so convinced. ......」

 「It's hard to understand the language of people who fight.」

 「I see... I don't understand...」

 「I understand that her core is shaky, but that's not the reason why he stopped the sword with his bare hands, is it!?」

 「Because he's a shachiken.」

 「Makes sense.」


　After a little teaching, Hoshino's stance was much better.

　I've done some instructor-type work with some awakened people in the past, but at the time it was hard to get them to understand what I was saying, but for some reason Hoshino understood what I was saying very easily.


　Maybe I'm getting better at teaching ......?


"Good. Put your feet planted on the ground and your shoulders open. Yeah, that's good."

"Great!　With that, there's no loss of strength!"

"Then stretch your back muscles with a line of force. Don't put too much pressure on your arms yet. Don't swing the sword with your arms, but with your body. Send your power from your legs with a jerk. Then swing the sword with a "bang," "thump" and "woosh"."

"Let's see. ...... "bang," "thump", "woosh"!"


The wall of the cave we are in was gouged out with a bang as Hoshino swung the sword as she was told!　

　There are still some details to be fixed, but it's much better. With this, I can make full use of Hoshino's power.


 「I can't take this anymore, you couple of brainiacs.」

 「How do you know what's going on with that explanation?」 (Tl: I wonder (╥﹏╥) translating it has been hell)

 「Yui-chan was also a fighter, wasn't she? ......」

 「It means that fighting people are drawn to each other.」

 「Shachiken!　You're responsible for this!」

 「If you think about it, she was able to hold her own against a bunch of ogres, so she's pretty strong, isn't she, Yui?」

 「I'm sure you can get a class A license in no time.」

 「I like a strong Yui, too.」

 「What?　My Tanaka is stronger than Yui.」

 「 A real Tanaka fanatic!」


"And since you're using a big sword, you should use this aspect more. The big sword can be a shield to protect you. You can catch it or catch it at an angle and slide it. That way you'll be better protected."

"The sword as a shield, huh? I had never thought about it."


　I taught him a few last tips on how to use the greatsword.

　The best way to do this is to use a good, solid, and reliable tool.


"Well, that's about all I have to say. Well, we should get going. I'm going to get depressed if I stay in this cramped place forever."

"Oh, yes!　Let's see, that's ...... Mr. Tanaka. If you don't mind, may I ask you to teach me some more things?　Um, I'd like to thank you!"

"I don't mind if I do. I'm happy to teach Hoshino."


　Hoshino happily said, "Ehehe, I did it. Thank you," she said cutely and happily.

　She's such a serious girl to want to be so strong.


 「Akan yui-chan, you're too cute.」

 「Seriously, you don't realize how much she likes you now?」

 「A man who became insensitive in exchange for strength.」

 「Go for it, Yui!　Drop Tanaka!」

 「Push him down!」

 「Embrace him!　Hold him!　Embrace him!」

 「Normally people don't like it when girls act forward. but they're making us cheer for them.」

 「Because Tanaka is the heroine of this game: ......」

 「Heroine (ordinary salaryman male)」

 「The definition of "ordinary" is broken.」


"Now, let's see which way to go, let's go to this side for now. We're in the depths here, and monsters may suddenly appear, so be careful."

"Yes!"


　The narrow cave we are in has paths on both sides.

　If the wind blows, we can see that side leads to the outside, but unfortunately, there is no wind at all in the cave. We have no idea which way leads to the outside.


"Well, if push comes to shove, we can just slash the whole cave upward, but that's the last thing we want to do because it would be dangerous if it collapsed."


 「You're too brainy for that.」

 「Tanaka the human rock drill.」

 「I'm sure Tanaka will be fine, but Yui will be in danger. ......」

 「Is this really the deep level?　I'm not too nervous.」

 「For Shachiken, the deep layer is like a workplace.」

 「I hate it that my workplace is my home.」

 「Tanaka!　Come back safely!」

 「I'm cheering for you from work too. Good luck!」


　As I glanced at the comments, I saw several comments of support.

　I am very grateful. I must return home safely to live up to everyone's expectations.
