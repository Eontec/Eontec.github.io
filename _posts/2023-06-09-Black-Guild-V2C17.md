Tl: Sam

…

　Together with Hoshino, whose color had improved, I proceeded through the cave.

　The width of the cave is constant and there are not many ups and downs. The shape is relatively easy to walk in, but....


"Hah, hah,......, how far does it go?"
<!--more-->

"I don't feel like we're reaching the exit. ......"


　The cave was much longer than I had expected.

　No matter how much you walk, the scenery never changes, so it even feels as if you're stepping on the spot. Maybe the exit was in the opposite direction, but there was no turning back now.


　I thought that the viewers must be bored with such an unchanging scenery, so I glanced at the comments.


「Thank you for the background music for my work.」

「I've been waiting for the Tanaka Cave Exploration ASMR.」

「Great job meeting a niche demand.」

「The sound of Tanaka's breathing mixed with the sound of him walking and clacking makes for a perfect harmony.」

「I collect Yui's voice when she sometimes makes a panicky sound when she's about to make a mistake.」

「The level of the audience here is very high.」

「Tanaka!　You can hum a tune once in a while!」


"............"


　I pretend I didn't see it and keep walking.

　It's fine that I'm not bored, but why are these guys so happy? Do only perverts come to my stream?


　And while I'm walking around like that, checking the comments every once in a while, suddenly a spacha comes flying in.


《Hiroki》「[\60000] I'm the explorer you saved in the middle level!　After Tanaka-san and Hoshino-san saved me, I was able to get out of the dungeon safely and am now being protected by the Administration!　Thank you so much!」


　What a surprise, it was the explorer that Hoshino and I had saved.

　Apparently they made it out of the dungeon safely. I was really relieved because I was worried. It was worth all the hard work.


「Hiroki!　You're safe!」

「Oh, thank goodness!」

「It was worth the effort!」

「If it wasn't for Shachiken, you'd be dead for sure. I'm so happy for you.」

「Yui, you're the MVP, too. She took his place.」

「That's true. She's too virtuous to protect others by using herself as a shield like that.」

「She also has big boobs.」

「What does that have to do with anything?　Is there a ......?」

「I'm surprised you agree.」


　I also told Hoshino that an explorer named Hiroki had made it out safely.

　Then she said, "Really?　I'm so glad!". I was happy. Thank goodness.


《Hiroki》「It seems that the Dungeon Management Bureau is now organizing a dungeon search party. I've asked them to help Tanaka-san as well, so please wait a moment!」


「Thank you very much for that. Please get some rest, Hiroki-san.」


　According to him, the survey team is heading this way, but ...... unfortunately, I can't expect them.

　I'm in the deep end. I'm sure there aren't many people who can come here in the first place.

　And I'm not even sure where in the depths this place is. I am sure that I am in a cave, but that's all.

　Even if the survey team reaches the deeper level soon, I don't think they will be able to find us soon. I don't think they're going to find us anytime soon. So the situation is not getting much better.


　As I was walking along thinking, "I've got to get out of this cave somehow and fast," I noticed something.


"Hmm? What is this?”


　As I was moving forward, a large "scar" suddenly appeared on the wall of the cave.

　Hoshino and I recognized it.


"Hey, Tanaka-san. What is this?”

"Oh, I'm sure of it. This scar was made by Hoshino."


　The scratches on the cave wall were very similar to the ones I had seen on Hoshino when I taught her how to swing a sword.

　I looked at the floor and saw pieces of shiny mushrooms that I must have dropped when I was cooking. No doubt, we're back where we belong.


"Oh, that's not right!　Because we hmm, we walked straight!　There wasn't even a fork in the road!"


　Hoshino was distraught.

　We were walking as hard as we could, and now we're back at the starting point. It's natural to be confused.


「What, what's going on!」

「I'm going crazy!」

「Hey, I don't think you know what's going on, ...... I really don't.」

「I'm an idiot, I don't know, hmm?」

「I'm just an idiot, I don't know.」

「Oh, you're stuck?」

「I'm afraid of infinite loops」

「'Shachiken, keep up the good work!」


　The viewers are also confused.

　But if I panicked now, even I wouldn't be able to save the day. In the dungeon, the unusual is the usual. Unbelievable things happen on a daily basis. Those who lose their cool in a panic die first.


　I calmly analyze the current situation.

　A dungeon is a messed up place, but there is always an answer to the mystery.

　I gather information and make deductions.


"The scar on the wall. It's the same as the one Hoshino got, but it's a little 'thinner' than the first one."

"Huh?　Is that so?　I don't know, but ......"

"Ah, no doubt about it. The first wound was much deeper."


　After observing the scar, I picked up the next piece of mushroom that had fallen.

　When I touched the surface of the mushroom, it was a little slimy. This mushroom, Luminous Cap, is not a slimy mushroom.

　This means that the surface is "melted". This is also important information.


　Next, I turned to Hoshino.


"Hoshino. You look awfully tired, is something wrong?"

“What?　Oh, yes, that's ...... true. I'm not walking at such a high pace, but for some reason I feel more tired than usual. It's because I'm nervous, right?"


　Hoshino tilts her head.


　　Walls that heal by themselves. Mushrooms melting. And the physical strength that is being taken away.

　Even if each one of them is not enough, if I gather information, I can find the answer. I had already arrived at the answer.


“Hoshino. Listen to me calmly. This is probably ...... the 'belly' of the monster."

"In the belly of the monster ......?　What?　Does that mean we are being eaten?”


　I nodded at Hoshino's answer.

　The dungeon also has huge monsters that are out of the norm.


　The black-robed sorcerer hmmm...he just transferred us into his belly.

　We thought it was a cave, and as we walked along, the digestive juices slowly drained our strength. By the time we realized something was wrong, we were too weak to escape.


But this is a complete wall of rock.　And why were we going around in circles in the same place?

I guess they are monsters whose bodies are made of rocks. Some of them can move their organs at will. They must have changed the shape of their intestines to prevent us from escaping.

"Oh, no. ......"


　Hoshino's face dyed in despair.

　She'd already learned that we'd been eaten and thought we couldn't be saved anymore.


「Seriously, how is that possible?」

「This is the great detective Tanaka.」

「A very physical detective.」

「This whole cave is inside the body of a monster. ...... Coto!」

「Wow... ......」

「That means they've already been eaten. It's a dead end.」

「No, that's not funny.」

「It means they're slowly being digested, right?　It's awful.」

「I knew it!」

「The black-robed sorcerer's methods are too harsh.」

「If you get eaten, you're already ......well ......」


　The comments section is also screaming.

　...... but there is a way out of this if you know what you're doing.

　I pull out my sword and face the rock wall.


"Don't worry, Hoshino. If they're monsters, you can just slash ...... them."

"What......?"

"I'm going to slice him open and get out."

"Oh, you can do that?"

"Of course I can do that. Do you think I can't slice through a rock like this?"


　The color of hope returned to Hoshino's face as I said this in an effort to encourage her. It was worth dressing up in front of a large audience.


"No, I believe in you, Tanaka-san!"

"Ok then, hold on to me. Let's get out of here as soon as possible."


　Hoshino nodded at my words and squeezed my waist.

　I distracted myself from the soft sensation on my back and swung my sword with both hands as hard as I could against the wall.


"Tanaka-style kenjutsu, 『Sever』"


　My sword slices through the rock wall like butter.

　The next moment, red blood gushes into the cave. I knew this was inside my body.


"Hold on tight!"

"Yes!"


　I held on to Hoshino, and then I jumped out of the cave, cutting through the blood so that she wouldn't get wet.
