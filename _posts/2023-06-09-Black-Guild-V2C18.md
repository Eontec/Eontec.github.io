Tl: Sam

…

　Relying on the light that shines into my body, I push my way through the monster's body.

　Suddenly, the surroundings become bright. It seems that I was able to get out safely.


"......Yoop!"


　I adjust my stance in the air and land on my feet.

　Then, I gently put down Hoshino, who was holding me in her arms, on the ground.
<!--more-->

"Kyuu....."


　My eyes are rolling because I moved pretty fast, but I'm not injured and I'm not covered in blood.  I'm sure I'll be able to move right away


"Hoshino, are you okay?"

"Hiyayi......, I can do it!"


　Hoshino regains consciousness clearly with a slap on the face.

　The monster that had been eating us was now visible.


"I see, it was him. ......」

"And it's huge!　What is this monster?」


　What loomed up in front of us was a earth dragon so large it could be mistaken for a mountain.

　The earth dragon is a wingless dragon species that walks on four legs. Because they cannot fly, their legs tend to be strong and their bodies hard.


　The dragon in front of me had scales made of hard rock, hard enough to repel even a half-hearted attack. If I were to fight it with my bare hands, it would give me a hard time.


"Tanaka-san. This monster is ......"

“It's an S-class monster, the “Mounted Dragon". Also known as the "mountain dragon," it is a huge earth dragon with a rocky body,......, but I've never seen one this large before. It is probably an abnormally grown individual. This guy must have caused the monsters in the deeper levels to flee to the lower and middle levels."


　A normal mount dragon is about 10 to 20 meters in length.

　The one in front of you, however, is a hundred meters long. It looks as if the 'mountain' is really moving.


「That's a monster!　It's huge!」

「It's too big! ......」

「I didn't know there was such a thing as an abnormally growing individual.」

「Isn't that something humans can do something about?」

「It looks like it could take a missile.」

「I don't think even Shachiken would be able to do that.　they got out of its body, so it's better to escape.」

「Yes, that's true.」


　A few of the comments here and there recommend that we run away.

　Mount dragons are slow. It would not be that difficult to escape. However,


"Thank you for your concern. However, if we do not defeat this individual now, the abnormal situation will not stop. It is difficult for the government to defeat an individual that has grown so large. ...... If left unchecked, there may be casualties."


　The government has a group called the "Subjugation Division" that specializes in hunting monsters.

　But they have their hands full and are not getting enough work done. The government is also working with the Black Dog Guild, so I know what I'm talking about.

Amatsuki, the chief of the Subjugation Division, must not be getting much sleep either. So it wouldn't be a bad idea to make her owe me a favor.


"I'm sorry, Hoshino. Can you wait a little while before you leave?"

"........!　Yes!　Of course!"

"Thank you. Just give me a minute."


　My companion agrees, and I walk up to the mount dragon.

　Although it has not yet attacked me in alarm, the mount dragon seems to be annoyed at having its belly split open.

　It is glaring at me with a low roar of "guuuuuu......".


『Gaaaahhh!』


　The mount dragon attacks me with a cry.

　It's a body slam that has no tricks up its sleeve. But when a mount dragon with the mass of a mountain unleashes it, it becomes a special move.


「Aaahhhh!」

「A mountain attacked him!」

「It looks like a landslide.」

「This is already a disaster.」

「Oh, oh, oh, oh, he's dead.」


　A moving mountain looms in front of us.

　I caught the blow from the mount dragon with my bare hands, right in front of ...... it.


"Hmph......!"


　I spread my hands out to catch the mount dragon's head.

　The mount dragon's body stops with a thud,......, though it moves backward a little bit.


"Heavy as a rock,......."


「Heavy as a rock,......, but not?」

「Why are you catching the mountain?」

「How many tons do you think it weighs?」

「This is already a glitch, isn't it?」

「It's just a weird level of strength.」

「It doesn't matter if it's a sword or not, it's a physical monster.」

「He's pulling Yui-chan too!」

「Look at her face, it's red, I think she's falling in love with him.」

「He's too much of a fighter.」


『Gau ......?』


　The mount dragon, whose own body has stopped, sounds puzzled.

　It doesn't seem to understand what's going on.


　I took advantage of the opportunity to put some strength into my arm and threw the mount dragon forward.

　The mounted dragon floated in the air for a few seconds, then fell to the ground with a roar.


"This much won't work, will it?　I'll deal with you."

『Uhu......!』


　Mount Dragon stood up and we exchanged glances.

　It's been a while since I've given it my all, but I don't seem to mind.


　I glance over at the time and see that it's now past 5pm.

　It's almost 6:00 p.m. ......, which means it's almost closing time.

"I'm sorry, but I don't want to work overtime. I'll finish this at once."


　I declared and rushed out.
