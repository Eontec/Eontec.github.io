『Goaaaaaaaah!!!』


　As I run forward, the mount dragon roars in fury.

　I guess it had never experienced being thrown down before. He looks pretty angry.


『Grrrraaaa......!』


　The mount dragon opened his mouth wide and looked at me.

　Then his mouth began to glow red.


　The next moment I thought "No way," and a huge heat ray shoots out of the mount dragon's mouth. I quickly stepped to the side and was able to avoid it, but the dungeon wall where the heat ray hit was melted to mush.


"I never thought a solid dungeon wall could be like this. Looks pretty hot if it hits. ......"


「Is it only hot ......?」

「That's the end of the story」

「People would be vaporized by something like this.」

「I'm sure Tanaka will be fine.」

「I'm shaking because it looks like he's really going to be okay.」


　But still, a mount dragon can't blow heat rays, can it?

　This one is not only big, but it seems to be a very special one. If we don't defeat it soon, it might affect the outside too.


　If the magic essence concentration in the dungeon rises too high, the magic essence concentration in the space outside the dungeon ......, where ordinary people live, will also rise.

　When this happens, monsters leave the dungeon and begin to attack ordinary citizens.

　This phenomenon, called a "monster disaster," rarely happens, but once it does, the damage is enormous.


　Last year, I believe, the news reported that a small country was destroyed by this phenomenon.

　We can't let that happen in Japan.


『Gaaaah!』


　The mount dragon moves its body at a speed that doesn't match its huge body, and tries to crush me with its foot.

　It would have been painful to be trampled by this huge body. I jumped to the side to avoid it, but the mount dragon swung its legs down on me again and again in an insistent attempt to crush me.


「I'm so scared lol.」

「Oh, the mountain is coming down.」

「It feels so immersive.」

「It's shaking so much. It's like an earthquake.」

「Sometimes it's sunny, sometimes it's a mountain.」

「But seriously, how is he going to knock it down?　I mean, it's impossible for a single person to take down a mountain.」

「Well, I'm sure it'll be fine. I don't know how he'll do it though.」

「I live in Shinjuku and it's shaking a little ......」

「There was a real earthquake and I'm really feeling it...」


　As I looked at the comments while avoiding it, I realized to my surprise that this shaking was happening all the way up to the top of the dungeon. This might cause some injuries if we don't settle this soon.


'Gah!'


　The mount dragon swung its leg down as hard as it could.

　I ducked it and fired a blow with my iai.


"Tanaka-style kenjutsu, Blink!"


　With a "Ging!"　The front legs of the mount dragon are sliced in two.

　The mount dragon loses its balance and falls to the ground, hitting its head hard against the ground.


「Seriously, he did it!」

「Such a thick leg in an instant .......」

「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the strongest!」

「Today's tie was amazing. Are there any overseas visitors here?」

「It looks like overseas D-tubers spread the word. I think some overseas D-tubers have spread the word that the samurai from back then is still at it.」

「I remember when the first stream went viral. I miss it.」

「This is a composite video, right?　Please tell me it is!」 （Tl: said in English)

「Here we go!」

「First time in Shachiken, huh?　Well, take your time.」

「You're just starting to act like you're an old-timer.」


『Gaaaah ......aaaah!"』


　The mount dragon grunts in pain as its leg falls off.

　When the mount dragon tried to approach to finish him off, he pressed the severed side of his arm against a rock that had fallen nearby.

　The next moment, the rock changed shape and became a new leg of the mount dragon.


　I never would have guessed that a fallen rock could repair a body, what kind of regenerative power does he have? Maybe that's the reason why this thing has grown so big.

　Maybe it grew up by taking in all the rocks in the area.


But ...... it's still the same thing. It can only regenerate so many times, right?


　If it regenerates, you can cut it over and over again.

　When I took a step closer, the mount dragon stepped back, still staring at me. It seems that the blow I had just struck had put him on alert.


「[Sad news] Mount Dragon-san is scared.」

「Dragon is scared!　Hey hey hey!」

「Its legs are shaking. He's so cute.」

「Mount Dragon, I'm crying because he's being mounted by the viewers.」

「I pity him!」

「If I ever become a monster, I don't want to meet Shachiken alone.」

「Tanaka!　Finish it!」


　I approach, wondering where to slash next.

　Then, the mount dragon said, 『Gyuaaaaaah!』 a high-pitched squeal that I had never heard before.

I was wondering what the hell was hmming, and one after another, wizard-type monsters appeared through the cracks in the rock shell of the mount dragon and surrounded me.


"...... come to think of it, you guys were in on it, weren't you?”


　I was originally in the belly of the mount dragon because of the black-robed wizard. These guys had a cooperative symbiotic relationship with the dragons.


　The dragon provides a comfortable home away from the enemy, and the wizards provide fresh food for the dragon's body and catch.　A tag team that no other monster can compete with.


『Gigi ......!』


　The wizards look at me and smile. They all look like they don't expect to lose.


　But still, ......, it's annoying. I'm trying to get home on time, and you're getting in my way.


"You guys are going to be my next opponent, ......?　I'll end this as soon as possible."


「You look so scary!」

「All office workers who are trying to leave on time have this look on their faces.」

「This is a top-notch corporate warrior.」

「Even the wizards are scared.」

「A working man is a strong man.」

「He's a company man who works 350 hours of overtime a month. He's got a different look.」


　I regained my grip on my sword and slashed at the wizards.
