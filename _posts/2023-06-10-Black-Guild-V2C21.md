Tl: Sam

…

　The mount dragon collapses with a rattling sound.

　It's like he can no longer sustain his body now that he's dead.


「Eh, eh, eh, eh!」

「Huh!」

「You're lying, hey ......」

「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」
<!--more-->

「He hit it with a single blow.」

「I didn't know you could cut mountains with a sword.」

「Tanaka's attack felt so good!」

「I thought I wouldn't be surprised anymore, but you scared the shit out of me.」

「I shit my pants, too.」

「That's funny, because so did I.」

「I'm already losing my butthole,」


　I glanced at the comments and saw that they were pretty excited. It was worth a shot.

　I hopped on top of the collapsing mount dragon to keep my legs from falling off, "Ho, ho." I ran over to Hoshino as I jumped.


"Hoshino, are you hurt?"

"Ah, yes!　Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Tanaka!　Um, uh, ...... was brilliant!　That was cool!"


「Yui, you look like a maiden in love!」

「This is 'fallen', isn't it ......?」

「They are fighters, so it's inevitable that they are attracted to strong men.」

「That woman ...... is so hot for Tanaka. ......」

「Well, well, it's natural that she's in love with Tanaka, so let's forgive her that much. Well, if she makes a move on him, that's one thing, but ...... right?」

「The way the viewers here are getting mad, I knew it was wrong.」

「Shachiken *lick lick*.」


"Haha, thanks. But you shouldn't say things like that too often. Men will get the wrong idea."

"............ yes."


「Mmm, my chest hurts.」

「Oh, you ...... really .......」

「Haaaaaaahhhh (big fucking sigh).」

「I'm rooting for you, Yui.」

「I'm pretty sure they recently created the crime of insensitivity, right?　If not, let's make one.」

「Hmph, little girl. Don't get too carried away, okay?」

「Don't get too cocky, you little punk.」

「If you learn from this, you'll learn not to make eyes at me.」

「These guys reek of petty .......」


　I saw out of the corner of my eye that the comments were blasting away, but I ignored them because they were probably just jokes again, as usual. These guys are so quick to try to stick us together.

　I wish they would consider Hoshino's feelings a little.


"Hoshino's last attack was good. If she can do that well after just one lesson, she's done well."

"Oh, thank you very much!　I'll work even harder and become as strong as you, Tanaka-san!"


「It's amazing what you can aim for after seeing that. ......」

「I even thought about retiring as an explorer.」

「Well, she's pretty strong too.」

「It's a shame she's been buried until now. I just went to Yui's channel and saw that her subscriber base has been growing like crazy.」

「I'll give you some money the next time you stream. I hope you eat a lot of delicious food.」

「I'm sure some of the Shachiken fans are subscribing too. There's a possibility that Shachiken will be on her channel.」

「It's good to have more channels to look forward to. The stronger explorers usually don't stream.」


"Well, enough talking, let's get the hell out of this dungeon, because it's getting close to 6:00 p.m. But first, let's go to ...... and get that one."

"That?"


　I remove the crumbled remains of the mount dragon and find what I'm looking for.

　It was a reddish-black rock about two meters in diameter. The rock was red hot and still pulsating. As one would expect from a dragon, it has an amazing life force.


"Mr. Tanaka, this is ......."

"This is the heart of the mount dragon. If it is the heart of an abnormally grown individual, I thought it would be more powerful than ordinary ones, but it is much more than I imagined."


　Dragon hearts are a rare material that fetches a high price. This heart will be one of the most expensive.

　The heart of a mount dragon is also called the 『Mountain Dragon Core』 and this heart has so much energy that it still pulsates. If I had to give it a name, I would call it the 『core nucleus mountain  dragon』


　I have had opportunities to slay dragons in the past, but during my days as a company employee, no matter how many rare materials I took, Suda would confiscate them, so I didn't actively take them. Sometimes I would quietly smuggle them out and use them as materials to strengthen my suit, but that was about it.


　But from now on, I can use what I get for myself. How wonderful. ......


"It's a waste to sell it, Let's use it to strengthen our weapons."

"I understand,......, eh!　Me too?"

"It is an ironclad rule for explorers to share the credit. You may not like it, but you'll accept it, right?


　Hoshino is reserved, so she says a little nastily.

　Young and promising explorers are very valuable. It would be okay to meddle at least this much.


　Hoshino pondered for a moment, then answered.


"I understand. It would be rude to refuse, so I'll take it."

"I'm glad to hear that. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your time is to be prepared for the unexpected. I know a good craftsman and I'll introduce you to him."

"Thank you very much ......, is that a date?"


「Date times kitteh!!!!」

「Yui, you look so happy, I'm happy too.」

「You showed your manhood, Tanaka!」

「I'm really looking forward to it.」

「I'm waiting naked until the date stream.」

「Don't embarrass yourself」


“It's not that big of a deal to have a date. It's just a little shopping."

"Yeah, it is ......."


「Hey, ！！！！！.」

「Just give me a break, man!」

「Tanaka!」

「I haven't been ...... pissed off in a long time. ...... Let's go to the dungeon. ......」

「He's a company animal. He's so brokenhearted that he can't understand how people feel. I hope you can forgive him. ......」

「Yui is so cute with her cheeks puffed out. I feel sorry for her.」

「Poor and cute.」

「The birth of Yuifugu, the future mascot.」

「I want to pinch her cheeks.」


"Well, I'd better put this heart away and go home."


　I take out my business bag and stuff my heart in it.


「Why do you put the heart in the bag with a normal face?」

「Your bag is so stuffed.」

「Oh no, the picture is too surreal.」

「It's too funny to do something so stupid with a serious face.」

「I can't fit any more in the bag. ......」

「It's going to be a moe character.」


"Well, now that we've done what we have to do, let's go home. It's still quiet now, but with the death of Mount Dragon, the depths of the city will be lively. The time is ...... and it's less than half an hour to the regular time. I don't want to work overtime, so let's get the hell out of here."


　I look for a way home.

　There are several paths in this big room, but I don't know which one leads to the top.

　As I'm trying to figure out what to do, I notice a large hole in the ceiling of the room. I think I can get to the lower level at once by running through there.


"Hoshino, by the way, can you run along the wall?"

"What?　The wall?　I haven't tried it, but I don't think so."

"I see. Then, please bear with me for a little while."

"Eh, ah, Kyaa!!"


　I held Hoshino in my arms and leaped to the ceiling. Then I put my feet on the wall of the hole as it is and walk up the vertical wall.


「Haaaaah!」

「 He's climbing up the wall.」

「This must be a bug move.」

「Gravity should be working.」


　I thought vertical wall climbing was a basic skill for dungeon explorers, but judging from the viewers' reactions, it doesn't seem to be so.

　It's not that difficult. Surprising.


"Hiiii!? You're climbing the wall!?"

"Hoshino can do it too if you grip the wall tightly with the soles of your feet. I'll teach you next time."


　With Hoshino still a little freaked out, I headed for the entrance to the dungeon at once.
