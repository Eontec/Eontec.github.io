Tl: Sam

…

"I heard on the news that Suda's guy is going to be in court soon. Since you're involved, I wonder if you'll be in court?"

"I don't know. I don't care what happens to him, so I don't want anything to do with the trial."


　Suda is the former president of the guild I belonged to.

　It's true that I was having a hard time because of him. I guess I could have made a lot of money.

　But I don't care about him anymore. I'd rather think about a happy future.
<!--more-->


　By the way, I, Adachi, and Suda are childhood friends.

　Of course, Adachi is friends with Suda. Well, I heard they haven't seen each other once since they graduated from junior high school.



"I guess you're right, I'm sure you don't even want to look at him. But still,......, he wasn't such a bad guy in the old days. But if his character has become that twisted, it will be impossible to correct him. He is truly pathetic."


　Adachi said somewhat sadly.

　Perhaps he feels responsible for not being able to stop his friend from going crazy.


"I think I'll stop talking about such trivial matters. We're celebrating today. Oh, it looks like our guests will be here soon, huh?

"Guests?"


　I nodded my head at Adachi's words.

　I didn't hear anything about anyone else coming.


"Who the hell did he invite?　If you mean our mutual acquaintance ......, could it be Amatsuki?"

"Well, just wait and see. ...... Oh, looks like they're here."


　The door to the private room opens and a person walks in.

　The person was someone I knew ...... or rather someone I had just recently met.


"Hoshino?　Why are you here?"

"Hehehe ...... I'm here."


　Hoshino comes in looking a little embarrassed.

　She wondered where to sit, but Adachi urged her to sit beside me. Well, that's fine, but ...... for some reason the distance was closer than usual.

　I've never had any experience with women, so my heart is pounding. If it's in the dungeon, it'll be in work mode, so it's okay to some extent, but if it's above ground, it's no good.

"Hey, Adachi, how come you're the one who's communicating with Hoshino?"

"I can use your social media accounts. I sent a DM to Yui's account and she replied that she'd be right over. I made sure to tell her that it wasn't you who sent the DM."


　Adachi says without a hint of apology.

　I see ...... that social networking site also has DMs. I never used that function so I didn't realize I was in contact with Hoshino. I've never used that function before. (Tl: Probably Twitter)


"I'm sorry!　I knew I should have told Tanaka-san beforehand, right?"

"No, it's not Hoshino's fault. I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue. Hoshino must be busy."

"That's right! I'm fine! Um, if Tanaka-san calls me, I can come anytime!"


　Hoshino said in a panic.

　 　 　 　 I guess he's telling me that so it doesn't bother me. She really is a good girl.


"Adachi, why did you even call Hoshino?"

"That's because your popularity grew thanks to Yui-chan. Without her, your popularity wouldn't have grown so much. And ......."


　Adachi shifted his gaze from me to Hoshino.


"I have a feeling she's going to be a great explorer in the future. That's why I'm trying to get to know her while I still can."

"I see. ......"


　I agree with Adachi's words.

　At least in the Black Dog Guild, there was no newcomer as promising as her.


"That's why today is a social gathering and a dungeon survival commemoration. Isn't that fine?"

"Oh well, I guess it can't be helped. Hoshino, if you don't like eating with these two old guys, just tell me right away, okay?　I'll beat Adachi unconscious and let you go.

"Uh, yes."

"Tanaka, aren't you treating me badly?"


　I ignore Adachi's thrust and give Hoshino a rescue boat.

　I'm really annoyed by Adachi's behavior.


"Hoshino, come on, order some meat. Oh, do you girls prefer cold noodles or something?"

"Oh, no!　I'll have meat too!　Let's start with 20 servings of ribs. ......"

"Oh, my God, I haven't even gotten my wallet. ......"


　Adachi worriedly checks his wallet.

　It was too late to regret having invited two hungry explorers. Hoshino, now in full eating mode, ordered a mountain of food from the waitress.


　Since such a large number of dishes could not be placed on the table at once and the meat would get cold if it was served, the waitresses would bring them to the table sequentially as soon as they were eaten.

　This is the way they often do it when explorer customers come to the restaurant. The waiter was very experienced.


"...... Well, there's nothing worse than talking about money at a celebration. Now I'm going to go out on a limb!　You guys eat till your stomachs burst!"


　Adachi holds the mug that was brought to him in a state of despair.


　Along with that, I have a beer, and Hoshino has a soft drink.


"I'd like to make a toast to their return and to our meeting."

" "Cheers!" "


　With that, we clinked glasses and began to enjoy our meal.
