Tl: Sam

…

"Ahh. I'm full."


　After a pleasant dinner party, I was returning home alone on the road at night.

　I wondered when was the last time I had eaten so much meat. Hoshino seemed to be enjoying herself, and it was a nice dinner party.


"One thing I will miss is that I didn't get too drunk. Well, that's just the way it is. ......"
<!--more-->


　The awakened person has a higher tolerance to poisons and other substances.

　That tolerance, sadly, also affects alcohol.


　In short, they can no longer get drunk. My tolerance is probably higher than other explorers because I ate a lot of strange food in the dungeon. I probably wouldn't even be able to get tipsy with the kind of alcohol that normal people can drink.


　The special alcohol in the magic liquor "Shinsuishu" that can be found in the dungeon has more than 100% of the potency of regular alcohol, so it can get you drunk, but you can't find much of that either.


"Well, I guess it can't be helped. ...... hmm?"


　When I get to the side of the house, I notice someone standing near the house.

　The first thing that comes to mind is that the person has a tremendous fighting spirit about him or her. It's as if he's about to duel, and that kind of fighting spirit is really getting to me.


　I tried to quietly walk past the person, trying not to get involved. But when that person saw me, they called out to me, "Wait.


"Wait, where are you going?"

"Eh?"

　I turn my head to look at the familiar voice, and to my surprise, there is my childhood friend, Kanade Amatsuki. (Tl: Finally ( ˘ ͜ʖ ˘))

　Why is she here?


"You finally came back. I'm tired of waiting."

"I'm sorry about that ......, but why is Amatsuki here?　Did I tell you where I live?"

"Don't underestimate the information power of the Subjugation First Division. They know where everyone lives."

"Say, ......."


　It's an abuse of state power. It's a terrible thing.


"Anyway, I'm here to talk. I'll be done soon. Can you come to the park?"

"I don't want to just stand around talking, so why don't you come over to my place?　Can I at least offer you some tea?"


　I suggested, but Amatsuki shook her head.


"I don't have that much free time. I'll be done soon and go home." (Tl: Nooooooooo(╥ ‸ ╥))

"I see. That's too bad."


　I haven't talked to Amatsuki properly for the past seven years.

　I thought I could bridge that gap, but it seems that I can't.

　Well, now that I'm out of the guild, I can see her whenever I want to.

　I don't think we'll be able to be ...... friendly like we used to be, but I'd like to be able to talk to her in a normal way.


"Is ...... this the right place?"


　Amatsuki said as she came to the park and stood by the iron bars.

　The occasional flashing streetlight and moonlight illuminate Amatsuki's face. Amatsuki has always had a beautiful face, but now that she is an adult, her beauty is even more polished.


　If I had not known her, I would have been too nervous to talk to her. Amatsuki had become such a beautiful woman.


"I told you before, Minister Dojima wants to meet you. Tomorrow around thirteen o'clock, please come to the Ministry of Magic. I will send someone to meet you."

"Tomorrow........., that's again very sudden."

"Oh, do you have something to do?"

"No, I don't, but ......"


　As a freelancer, I have no schedule.

　The first thing to do is to talk to the person you're talking to about the first contact.


　After the first contact, Amatsuki switches to the next topic.


"And ...... the first trial of Akihiro Suda, the former president of the Black Dog Guild, will be held next week."

"...... I see."


　Apparently, it's been scheduled just like Adachi said it would be.

　It looks like the evidence has already been gathered.


"Did you come here today to ask me to testify at that trial?"

"No. No. We have already gathered enough people to testify at the trial. The guy who was doing the paperwork at the guild is ready to tell us the whole story."

"Oh, ......, I see."


　Suda was hated by almost all of the employees.

　Now that he's been caught, no one is going to take his side.


"Still, there were some who said that you, as an important witness, should be called to trial,......, but you've become too famous in the last few days. If you come, there will surely be an uproar. So we'll just use your testimony and the video data."

"I see. I don't want to see his face either."


It might be naive to say this, but I still have some sentiment toward Suda. It's not like I'm forgiving him for what he did to me, but I don't want to see him on trial.

　So I'm okay with this. I don't think I'll ever see him again.


"I'm also taking care of the unpaid overtime and the shortfall in salary that was unfairly lowered so I can give it to you. I don't know what they were using it for, but there wasn't much money left in the guild, so I don't think I can give you all of it. ......"


　Amatsuki says apologetically.

　Although she has a snobbish attitude, after all, it seems that the inside is still as gentle as before.


"I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get the money. I want you to give that money to other employees. I'm sure it's hard for them now that they've all left the guild."

"Eh......?"


　Amatsuki looked surprised.

　I'm sorry, but I wasn't going to take that money because I know you've gone through a lot of procedures.


"I'm lucky enough to make a lot of money, but the rest of the employees don't, do they?　Some of them don't have a job yet, some of them have families. I want you to give them the money first. If there is still money left over after all of that is done, I'll take it too."


　When I told him this, Amatsuki's expression changed from surprised to kind, and he smiled thinly.


"...... you haven't changed, have you?"

"Huh?"


　I tilted my head, not understanding what she was talking about.


"You've always been like that. You've always put yourself on the back burner and worry only about others."


　Saying that, Amatsuki walked right up to me.

　I was so close to her that I could feel her breath on my face. I was so nervous and my heart was pounding.


"When I was little, you protected me from bullies. After I became an explorer, you protected me from monsters."

"Haha, is that right ......?"


　I felt embarrassed and covered it up with a laugh.

　It certainly happened. Amatsuki used to be very fond of me when she was little. I also thought of Amatsuki as my little sister and meddled in her affairs.


"But Suda took advantage of that and used you to his advantage. I took a good position in the government to give you a way out, so that one day you would be welcomed into the Subjugation First Division."

"Oh, really?"


　I was surprised at those unexpected words.

　I was surprised at first. Amatsuki didn't seem like the kind of person who would work for the government.


　I was ...... surprised that she was doing it for me.


"And yet you became a streamer!　And you've become so famous for saving a girl's life without regard for the risks!　You're ruining the whole plan!"

"Uh, that's ...... sorry."


　Overwhelmed by Amatsuki's spirit, I involuntarily apologize. (Tl: THIS IS IT PEOPLE, this is what a real heroine is like)

　I was not intending to do this, but I had stepped on Amatsuki's feelings.

　The words that came out of Amatsuki's mouth were far different from what I had in mind.


"There's always been that reckless and good-natured part of you, and  love you for that." (Tl: I had to stand up just to take it in, Amatsuki for the win!!!!!!!)

"...... what?"


　Did I mishear you?

　The next moment, Amatsuki glared at me with sharp eyes and grabbed my tie with her right hand and pulled it tight.


　And then, ...... to my surprise, Amatsuki put her own lips on my lips. (Tl: I'm screaming, hopping hyperventilating and crying from the happiness, luckily I'm alone)


"mmm......"


　The soft sensation of my own lips against hers, and the sweet voice that escaped from Amatsuki's mouth, numbed my brain and made me violently confused.

　Even when I was trapped in the monster house in the depths, I was calm.


　After a long, long moment that felt like an eternity, Amatsuki loosened her grip on my tie and slowly released her lips.

　Her expression was the same as usual, but her white, translucent cheeks had turned bright red.


"I'm sure that no matter how insensitive you are, it will help a little if I go this far, right?　Well then, I still have some business to attend to, so ...... excuse me."


　Saying this, Amatsuki turned around and left the park.

　I let go for a while, but then I see her and try to follow her. Then Amatsuki stops right there and looks back at me with only half of her face.


"Just so you know, ...... that was my first time."


　I was so excited to see her, and I was so excited to see her.

　I was left alone in the park and looked up at the night sky where she had disappeared, touching my mouth where I could still feel it.


...


*Tl Note*: And with that We've officially caught up with the author(For real this time)... I haven' reacted so emotionally to a novel scene for quite a while. I'm a strong advocate for Amatsuki superiority, and at least that man-stealing witch didn't have her way (even though, she probably will cuz it's harem). Author uploads daily, so should I Translate one chapter a day? or two every two days? Let me know in the comments, I'll probably take a poll for it
