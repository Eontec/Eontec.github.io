Tl: Sam 

…

　Rin takes me on a walk through the Ministry of Monster Control.

　It's been a while since I've been here, but not much has changed inside.


　The budget is in order, and the place is well-cleaned. There are irresponsible people who ask for a budget cut in years when the number of monsters has decreased, but it seems that the minister is doing everything in his power to get rid of them.
<!--more-->


　There is one thing that has changed since I was here in the past.

　It is ......


"......I feel like I'm being looked at a lot."


　Every staff member I pass is glancing at me.

　And they are talking secretly with other staff members about something. Are they talking behind my back or something? ......


　I was worried about that, and Rin sensed it and spoke to me.


"The staff knows that the Sensei will be here today. I'm sure everyone is interested in it."

"I guess I've been showing off too much.　I hope Dojima-san doesn't come to a place like this."

"......I think you're mistaken, but the staff doesn't want to smoke you out. In fact, it's the opposite."

"What?"


　Just as I was about to ask her what the hell was going on, a female staff member came up to me.

　I was prepared to think that she was here to complain about something, but to my surprise, she offered me a piece of paper with her signature on it.


"Ah, um!　May I have your autograph, if you don't mind?"

"Uh, Okay."


　I took the paper and pen and handed it to her with my name written on it.

　Then the woman bowed and left me. and leaves me.

　She joined her colleagues a short distance away and happily said, "I got it!　I got it!" She was so happy. The other staff members were talking about how nice it was and how they would like to ask for it too.


"I didn't think there were any fans of mine in the Ministry of Monster Control."

"Of course there are. The staff members here have a deeper knowledge of dungeons than the average person, and they can understand the greatness of Sensei more deeply than the average person."

"Oh, I see. ......"


　Rin explained it to me, but it still doesn't feel right.

　I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to this.


"Come to think of it, are you getting along well with Amatsuki?"


　I ask Rin as we walk.

　Amatsuki is the head of the Subjugation Division. She is Rin's boss.


"Yes. My sister ...... Amatsuki has been very good to me. I woke her up this morning as well."

"I see. You're still living together, right?"

"Yes, I am a disaster orphan, so the only person I can rely on is Chief Amatsuki."


　A disaster in which demons are taken out of a dungeon is called a "demon disaster". It is called Masai for short.

　Rin lost her family to a demon disaster at a young age and was taken in by an institution. After that, Rin found out that she was an awakened person and knocked on the door of the Subjugation Division at a young age to avenge her family's death, and she succeeded in getting in.


　From that time on, Amatsuki took the lead in taking care of Rin.

　They were so close that they looked like real sisters.


"That means I have younger sisterly qualities as well. That's a great bonus."

"What are you talking about, ......?" (Tl: Probably marketing herself)


　She still says the most absurd things with a clear face.

　That's what makes him so interesting.


"By the way, my sister has been acting strange since this morning. Do you know anything about it?"

"I have no idea....."


　I denied it, remembering what happened last night.

　Oh shit, my face is getting hot.

" *stare* "

"Well, let's get going!　We don't want to keep the minister waiting!"

"...... understood. Minister Dojima is in the courtyard right now. This way, please."


　Accompanied by Rin, who looked at me questioningly, I stepped into the courtyard of the Ministry of Magic.

　There was a magnificent pine tree standing tall. They didn't have anything like this when I was here. Where did they get it from?


　But this pine tree was bent over like a [bonsai tree]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai ). ...... I approached the tree and saw that it was in a huge flowerpot.


　Is this really a bonsai?

　As I was puzzled, someone who was tending the pine tree with a big pair of scissors noticed me and approached me.


"You came, Tanaka!　I've been waiting for you!"


　A large old man came up to me with a hearty laugh.

　He had short gray hair and sharp eyes. He must have been close to 60 years old, but his body was as big and thick as a football player's.


　This man was Ryuichiro Dojima, Minister of the Ministry of Monster Control.

　He is the man in charge of dungeon-related matters in Japan.


"It's been a long time, Minister Dojima. I am glad to see you are in good health."

"What's with the way you're talking? Why don't you talk to me more frankly like you used to do? You're not even in the workforce anymore, are you?"

"......You've just been made a minister, so I'm being polite. Is this okay?"

"Oooh!　You can do it!　I'm glad to see you're still as cocky as ever"

　Saying that, Dojima-san slapped me on the back. The force of the slap was so great that I felt like I would be blown away if I didn't hold on to my feet. In fact, the ground cracked under my feet every time he slapped me.

　He is a very lively person.
