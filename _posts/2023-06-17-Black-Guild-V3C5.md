Tl: Sam

…

"This is the training camp. It's a nice place."

"It's very ...... spacious."


　Dojima-san took me to a huge gymnasium-like facility built behind the Ministry of Monster Control.


　　Everyone is in high spirits. They are all good warriors because Mr. Dojima is taking the initiative.


"Thank you for your hard work, Dojima-san!"
<!--more-->

　The people in the training area saluted when they saw Mr. Dojima.

　He is a funny old man in front of me, but he is a former member of the Self-Defense Forces and is spartan to his own people. He is strict about hierarchical relationships, but thanks to his charisma, he seems to be well-liked by the people here.


"Hey, look."

"That's ......."


　But the way he looks at me is suspicious.

　Hmmm, I guess they don't trust me. Well, when a dull guy like him suddenly becomes famous, it's no wonder people look at him with suspicion.

　D-tubers are also often looked at with a white eye.


"They can't forgive you either, can they?"

"Hey, Rin, calm down!　Don't draw your sword!"


　　I hurriedly held back Rin, who was about to attack them.

　Even if you are a member of the government, you can't afford to get yourself into trouble.


"I'm glad you're mad at me for my sake, but you don't have to do anything"


　I said as I looked at Kimura, whose eyes were filled with hostility.


"I'll let you know if I can handle it or not."

"Sensei ......"


　Rin turns a strangely enthusiastic gaze towards me.

　Maybe I was a little too cool?　I hope she doesn't think I'm lame.

　I've gotten into the habit of saying cool words to keep my sanity when I'm alone in the dungeon..

　So this is all Suda's fault.


"Isumi-chan, are you ready?"

"Yes, I'm ready."


　I noticed that Isumi-san was starting to roll the camera under the direction of Dojima-san.

　How long had he been preparing?


"Dojima-san, what's that?"

"A popular person came to our place. There's no way we won't use it for publicity. I was thinking of streaming this match on the Internet. It's a good idea since we have an official account with the Ministry of Monster Control."

"Are you sure you want to do that?"

"Hmm. I'm sure the other ministers will give me a hard time about it, but ...... it's fine!　If the need arises, I can just poke them in the head and make their memories fly away!"


　Mr. Dojima laughs, "Ha-ha-ha."

　I'm sure he's joking, but I'm afraid he might do it.


　Still, I wonder what Mr. Dojima is planning to do.　If SP loses this, the government's reputation will be damaged.

　I don't know what Mr. Dojima is thinking, but ...... well, he won't make it look bad. I'll take his word for it.


"Kimura, you good too?"

"Yes, I'm good. No problem."

"Okay, let's start streaming!"


　Mr. Dojima operates his phone and the stream begins.

　I also operate my phone to bring up the comment section of the stream in three dimensions.


「It's rare to see the Ministry of Monster Control streaming live.」

「Is there an incident?」

「Is it a press conference?」

「The summary section says something about a mock match, but what is it?」

「What's going on? - Is that Shachiken in the video?」

「No, it can't be... it's not... it's ......」

「No way!　We have to spread the word!」


　The number of viewers grew as time went by.

　It seems to be spreading through social networking sites as well. I wonder if it is really safe.


「What kind of stream is this?」

「I mean, Minister Dojima is here!」

「Oh my God, there's the devil Dojima here!」

「He's as muscular as ever. That’s not a minister's body!」

「Minister Dojima looked so cool at the Parliament the other day!」

「There's his secretary, Isumi-san, too!　Big sister!」


"Wow, that's Tanaka. The number of viewers is growing rapidly. This is getting fun."


　Dojima-san, in a good mood, explains the game to the viewers.

　I've been trying to keep the Yoyogi World Tree Dungeon under wraps and pretend that it was a test so that I can do my job for the government.

　Well, that's certainly not the wrong way to put it.


「It looks like a lot of fun!」

「Is this the first time you've streamed Shachiken fighting people?」

「Only when he punched Suda.」

「Tanaka!　Go for it!」

「The guy you're fighting looks pretty strong.」

「He sure looks scary!」


　The viewers were excited.

　Dojima-san, looking satisfied with this, holds something in his hand and looks at me.


"Here, Tanaka, use this as your weapon. It's sturdy, so you can swing it a little harder."


　I catch the sword that Dojima-san throws to me.

　It is a practice sword with a blunt edge. It is made of materials from the dungeon.

"If I think of it as a way to get a new job, I guess it's business. I'm not too excited about it, but I'll give ...... a try."


　I swung my sword a few times to set the tone.

　Then Kimura opened his mouth as he watched.


"I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave this job. This is our job."

"I didn't know SPs these days do dungeon research, though I don't know much about it. I am impressed by their diligence."


　Kimura's face clearly shows his miffed attitude as he says this.

　He doesn't seem to have a tolerance for agitation.


"The N-SPs belong to the "Special Security Division" that was newly established after the Great Devil's Disaster at the Imperial Palace. With us, there is no room for D-tubers."


　Apparently, Kimura takes great pride in his N-SP status.

　I think the "N" in N-SP comes from NEXT, right? In English-speaking countries, we call an awakened person "Next,".

　In other words, N-SP is a police organization composed only of awakened people.


"...... So they are the elite of the Metropolitan Police Department. You mean you can't give a job to a freelancer with a junior high school diploma?"

"You can take it that way."


　Kimura gripped his sword tightly.

　　He has an impressive stance, as he says.


「Sparks are flying between them」

「I hear N-SP is full of martial artists.」

「There's no way our Tanaka will lose, right?　No way, right?」

「But we only see D-tubers fighting, so we don't know much about the strength of other awakened people.」

「Finally, Tanaka's plating is coming off.」

「Hey there, anti-tanaka!」

「I didn't know there were still anti-tanaka. I thought they were extinct.」

「You're such a believer! You still believe in that old man?」


　The comments are getting more and more excited.

　Well, let's focus on what's in front of us now. You can check what was said later. I've never reviewed the archives I'm in.


"If you take one hit and that's it, there's going to be a grudge. The match shall continue until either you surrender or I deem it impossible to continue. After, if a fighter goes down, let's start over. I can't stream an action like hitting a downed person. Is that okay?"


　We both replied "Yes" to Mr. Dojima's words.

　I noticed that all the other people in the training ground were also watching our match. I don't like to be the center of attention, but ...... well, I'll do my best.


「I wonder who's going to win. I'm so excited.」

「Shachiken!　Don't lose to such an unattractive guy!」

「Well, Tanaka's on a roll, too, and I think it's time he was punished, don't you think?」

「What?　What do you mean, " He's on a roll"?　Go away, anti!」

「Go away, processed streamers!　You're getting worse.」

「It's getting rough.」

「It's hard to use the internet if you can't tell when something is doctored.」

「Well, we'll see when the game starts. We'll see if Shachiken is the real thing or not.」


　While the comments were getting lively, Dojima-san took his place as the referee and finally started signaling the start of the game.


"Then, both of you, fight fair and square. Get ready ...... begin!"


　As soon as Mr. Dojima shouts this, Kimura rushes in with his sword held in front of him.

　Kimura tries to swing his sword straight at my head. His movement is similar to that of a kendo player striking with a mask. He probably learned kendo in the police academy.


　There is no waste in his movements. They are precise and efficient.

　He probably put a lot of effort into it. But ......


"---- too slow."


　I sharply strike the back of Kimura's right hand with my sword faster than he can release his attack.

　*Crack*　Along with the sound, I could feel the bone cracking in my hand. Unable to bear the pain, Kimura dropped his sword to the ground, his face contorted.

　Not missing the opportunity, I quickly swing the sword at his face.


"I'll take the first strike."

"Stop ......!"


　My sword slammed into Kimura's face as if it was being sucked into his body.

　Kimura was hit hard in the face with a "mehkii" sound and was blown away by the impact, spinning several times in the air before falling to the ground.


「Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!」

「I still can't see you at all, lmao.」

「Huh?」

「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」

「Kimura-kun, is twirling around lol」

「Even an ordinary guy can beat the elite if he tries hard enough!」

「You're a real fighter!」

「Mr. Certified Processor, you're not saying anything.」

「How do you feel now, anti?　Hey, hey, hey, hey?」


"Gu, uh......"


　Kimura, who was blown away, stands up while holding the blood flowing from his nose.

　The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're looking for.


　I pick up the sword he dropped and throw it back at him.

　Kimura takes it and faces me again. I told him I was going to go that far. He can't take it back just because I hit him once.


"Come on. Let's go until you're satisfied."

"......Yeah, sure."


　kimura made a drastic change from the earlier statement and became serious as he replied.

Tl Note: Today is the last day for the voting, well, till I translate the next chapter. I'll post the results along with tommorows chaper, though there's a chance I won't be able to get a chapter out tommorow. I submitted the site to google to review for ads, But don't worry, I'll try to make the ads as minimal as possible, if you guys tap on them. I was planning on starting sponsored chapters and what not, but I still don't have any ways to accept donations. I have a patreon though, but I'm not really up on how it all works. Oh well, Happy Weekend
