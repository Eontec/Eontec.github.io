Tl: Sam

…

"That's enough!　What a good fight!"


　Dojima-san confirms that Kimura has passed out and shouts loudly.

　Then Rin, who was watching the game, came toward me and offered me water and a towel.


"Thank you for your hard work, Sensei. Um, that was cool."

"Really?　Thank you."
<!--more-->

　After wiping off my sweat and drinking the water, I replied, and Rin looked a little embarrassed and turned her head down.

　The viewers saw this and got excited.


「Hey, hey, who's that beautiful girl?」

「Yui, he's cheating on you!」

「She’s a cool beauty type ...... the complete opposite of the cute type Yui!」

「When did he drop her?」

「I want a harem development!」

「I've seen that girl on TV before. I'm sure she's the ace of the first subjugation division.」

「She's cute and strong, she's the best!」

「What?　Tanaka is strong and cute too!」

「You still have the same intense Tanaka fans.......」


"Ah, you're misleading the viewers again. Sorry Rin."


　Maybe people will go to town and say things like, "She's Shachiken's wife!" or something like that.

　I felt bad about that and apologized, but Rin's reaction was surprising.


"...... No, I don't mind at all, do you?"

"Eh?　Really?"


「Her face is totally a maiden in love!」

「This is already a confession, isn't it?」

「I saw a similar scene the other day.」

「I knew it! She's his wife!」

「Oh, no, not this again!」

「I love couples who are in love with each other.」

「She's totally in love with him, but he doesn't even know it. I know a lot about this stuff.」

「Well, that can't be right. ......, right?」

「He's got his entire skill tree devoted to combat.」


"Well, Rin's still so sweet that you don't ...... care!"

"...... no."


「Look at him, he doesn't even notice」

「I knew it.」

「Well, this is déjà vu!」

「Rin, you look so cute with your cheeks puffed out.」

「Damn, ......, I'm getting jealous!　I'm going to go get into a little dirty mood!」

「Go ahead and do it!」

「I'll forgive Rin for being cute when she's all pouty.」


　Ignoring the noisy comment section as usual, I look at the fallen Kimura.

　Just then, Dojima-san woke Kimura up and slapped him on the back to wake him up. He was as forceful as ever.


"Oh, you're awake."

"Minister Dojima......?　 I see......"


　Kimura, who looked around and grasped the situation, managed to get up and walked slowly toward me.

　I could see the remorse on his face.


　I returned the water and towel I had been given to Rin and faced Kimura.


"...... again, I apologize for my rudeness. I'm sorry.


　As Kimura bowed his head, I said, "That's okay. I'm not bothered by it," and let him raise his face. I looked him in the eye and praised him for his good fight.


"If there are many people like you, the Metropolitan Police Department will be in good hands. It was a good match." (Tl: Bro really said gg after wiping the floor with my guy lol)

"......!　Thank you, ......!


　Kimura and I shook hands firmly.

　The people who were watching the game applauded and cheered. Come to think of it, a lot of people were watching us. It's kind of embarrassing.


「That was a good match!」

「I've got to give Kimura a second look!」

「Shachiken is the best!　Shachiken is the best!」

「I'm a little moved, to be honest.」

「It's going to be made into a movie!」

「I'm impressed by the size of Shachiken's character. If only he wasn't so insensitive.」


　The comments were also very positive.

　Then Dojima-san comes to us.


"Gahahaha!　It rains and it pours, but the ground holds firm!　Good match!"

"Thank you, Dojima-san. Thanks to you, the misunderstanding on the Internet has been cleared up."

"What is this about? All I did was to take advantage of you and punish him for getting carried away."


　Dojima-san blurted out in a deliberate manner.

　It seems that he doesn't want me to owe him anything for this.


　He is probably trying to atone for not being able to help me out as a corporate slave. He's a righteous man.


"But are you sure about that?　Wouldn't it tarnish the government's image if you lost the game?"

"That won't be a problem. I will fight and show them my power."

"Oh, that's a relief. ......, eeh?"


　I make a dumb sound after the sudden words of Mr. Dojima.

　What did this old man just say?

"I've been doing a lot of paperwork lately and I just wanted to get in some exercise. Of course you'll come with me, won't you?"


　Dojima-san says, swinging the sword Kimura was using around.

　He's been planning to do this from the beginning, hasn't he?


"No, there is no reason for me to fight Dojima-san. Dojima-san has his own position, so don't be so selfish."

"What, are you afraid?　You are so pathetic. You are scared of an old man like me. I'm sure the old you would have ridden with me. You have become a corporate sword saint, and have become arrogant." (Tl: Instigator Lv max)

"No problem!　You just do whatever you want, don't you?"


「You took his bait lmao」

「Aren't you too good at stirring things up, Minister?」

「He’s always stirring things up in the Congress.」

「Shachiken vs. Dojima, the devil, isn't that too much to ask?　I wonder who's going to win.」

「Dojima-san is a legend too, he destroyed a terrorist organization made up of ...... awakened people by himself.」

「He's one of the seven returnees. Wouldn't even Shachiken be at a disadvantage?」

「Shachiken!　Show me your dream!」


　Dojima-san and I face each other, gripping our swords.

　In contrast to the excited comments, the inside of the training hall was quiet.


　Everyone here adores Dojima-san. Perhaps it was because they were able to watch the game of such an admired person, but their expressions were serious.

　I made sure not to miss his every move.


"One match is good, Tanaka. If you and I go at it until you fall, this building won't last. If your weapon is broken, you lose. It's too dangerous to do it with bare hands." (Tl: Too dangerous for them or the environment?)

"Yes, I understand. No problem."


　The bare hands of an awakened person with arms are more dangerous than a sword without a blade.

　 It is too dangerous to use indoors.


"I'm going to ask you to be the judge, Isumi. Now, Tanaka ...... "Let's do it until you're satisfied," right?　We can do the same."

"...... You're really good at stirring people up, aren't you? All right then, please check out how strong I've become."


　I grip my sword tightly and look at Mr. Dojima.

　 But now that I have overcome the hellish days of company slavery, I am sure that I am much stronger than I was then.


　I'll show you the results of my efforts here.


"Then...... Start!"


　With Isumi's shout, I started to run.

　The first move is always the winner. I don't intend to prolong the game.


"Haaah!"


　I drew my sword and swung it down at Dojima-san's face.

　The series of movements were, I thought to myself, lean and sophisticated. If it had been Kimura, he would not have been able to react.


　But it was that Dojima-san on the other end. He reacted to my attack with a grin, and with the sword in his hand, he caught my blow with a "Bash!"

　A shockwave scattered around the area, and a crack appeared at the foot of Dojima-san, who had caught it!

　Some of the spectators were blown away. However, Mr. Dojima, who was at the center of the impact, stood motionless. What kind of body structure does this guy have?


"Kuku. A heavy, good attack. It makes my blood boil."


　He said happily. Has he really not been out in the field lately?

　I step away and readjust my stance.


"I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. Now let me ...... get a little more serious. I'm full of respect for the elderly, you know."

"Ha-ha-ha!　You little brat! I'll play with you, so get your ass in here."


　Mr. Dojima was smiling happily.

　I put strength into my legs and started to run toward him again.



....


Tl Note: What a development, Even I couldn't predict it, but it doesn't feel forced (Except for like the actual forcing aand instigation), 10/10. And Rin couldn't possibly think she beats her boss/adopted elder sister in any way. I'll sail the Amatsuki Ship till either I or she dies.
