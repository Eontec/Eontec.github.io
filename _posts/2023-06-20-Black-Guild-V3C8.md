Tl: Sam

…

"Haaah!"


　I grip my sword tightly and slash at Mr. Dojima again and again.

　Bluffing by eye movement. An off-timing surprise attack. Attacks from blind spots. All of these are attacks that could be used against monsters in the deepest levels.
<!--more-->

　But Mr. Dojima dealt with these attacks with idiotic reflexes.


"Ha-ha-ha!　You've gotten so strong!　I've got my hands full just preventing your attacks!"

"Well said, you gorilla old man. ......"


　I swore at Dojima-san, who was catching my attacks with a cool face.

　Now, how can I find a way to make the most of it? ......


"I'm not amused that you're thinking in the middle of a fight!"

"Damn it, ......!"


　Dojima-san swung his sword as hard as he could at me.

　The shockwave was like a typhoon, and it made a huge mess of the training ground. I barely managed to avoid it, but some of the walls of the training ground were broken.

　The floor is also shattered. ...... This is going to be hard to fix.


"Why did you avoid it, Tanaka?　Fixing it isn't free anyway!　Our budget is being constricted even now!"

"It's not my fault, is it?"


「It's so messed up lol」

「They're both so monstrous, I don't know what's going on!」

「This is the Great Monster War, isn't it?」

「They're more like monsters than monsters!」

「They're more like monsters lol」

「Maybe it was the other way around. ......」

「I didn't know Dojima-san was this strong. I've heard he's strong, but...」

「He's the only man America has ever feared.」

「I heard that old people in other countries tremble when they hear the name 'Japanese dragon'.」


　While the comments were heated, Mr. Dojima slowly approached me.

　He looks intimidating. The Tyrant Dragon is starting to look cute.


"I'd like to enjoy it longer, but ...... Isumi is looking at me with scary eyes, so I'll have to end this quickly."

"It's because you're destroying the training grounds,......."


　　　　Dojima-san didn't seem to be sorry at all.

　This is why Isumi-san gets so mad at you!　


"Sensei! Please do your best!"


　As I was thinking about how I should attack the situation, I heard a voice saying that to me.

　The owner of the voice was Rin, who was watching the game. She was cheering me on in a loud voice that she usually doesn't use. I couldn't help but do my best if she did that.


"Let's go, Tanaka!"


　Dojima-san strikes again and again with his sword with the force of a storm.

　I handle all of his attacks from the front. No matter how great the power of the opponent is, it is easy to handle it if you change the flow and direction of the attack.

　The important thing is direction and timing. If I can grasp that, I can win even against someone stronger than myself.


"Ha-ha-ha!　You're a good fighter!　You have also learned the soft sword well!　Tachibana must be proud of you!"


　Dojima-san smiles happily.

　My sword master, Tachibana-san, was a genius with the "soft sword". I learned to use it by watching and imitating Master Tachibana, but compared to Master, I still have a long way to go.

　But in return, I can also use the "hard sword". If I use both of them, I should be able to catch up with Tachibana's strength.


「Shachiken, you are a physical monster, but you are also very skilled, isn't that amazing?」

「Isn't it strange that No. 1 is as strong as V3?」

「[Sad news] Training ground-kun is in tatters.」

「Our blood money is also in tatters.」

「I'm sure the minister will fix it with his own pocket money.」

「I mean, Kimura-kun looks stunned lol」

「He's surprised that the minister he's supposed to be protecting is this strong.」

「My escort target can't be this strong.」


“But you won't get one from me if you keep taking it!"

"I know. ......"


　I swung the sword with all my strength in a horizontal sweep, Dojima-san who caught it was blown away from me.

　I decided to make a run for it and win the game in one fell swoop.


"Come on, Tanaka!"

"I'll come even if you don't tell me. ......!"


　I bent down and started crouching start.

　I reached maximum speed at once, and I ran into Mr. Dojima, waving my right hand in the air.


"Come on!"


　I swing my right arm down toward Dojima-san, who is holding up his sword.

　Dojima-san tries to catch it just in time, but his sword fails to defend him.


　Because I didn't have a sword in my right hand. Not even Dojima-san can catch a sword that isn't there.


"...... Oro?"


　Dojima-san was bewildered, not knowing what had happened.

　I didn't miss that split-second window of opportunity.


　The sword that disappeared was now in the grip of my left hand. When I swung the sword behind my back, I had switched it to my other hand.

　From the front, it looks as if the sword has disappeared. This kind of technique is useful because we had been fighting each other from the front.


"Tachibana-style swordsmanship - hidden fangs."


　I pulled out the sword I had hidden behind my back with my left hand.

　Mr. Dojima immediately noticed this and tried to deal with it, but it was too late. The guard that had been raised to the upper level was not in time for the attack from below.


　With a "bang!"　My sword hit Dojima-san on the left side of his face.
