"I understand. Let's call it a draw. ...... haha."


「Shachiken gave up lol」

「He's going to have to hold a press conference to apologize.」

「This old man is really funny.」
<!--more-->
「Is this what a minister looks like ......?」

「Hmm?　Is he coming closer?」


　Dojima-san moved away from me and went in front of the camera, this time for the stream.

　Then he stepped closer to the lens and began speaking in close-up.


"Tanaka, who is so strong that he could compete with me, is now a member of the Ministry of Monster Control!　Not only that, but I am now calling on the other four returnees from the Imperial Palace dungeon. The Ministry of Monster Control is going to get stronger and stronger from now on!"


　Mr. Dojima declared with pride.

　But even so, gathering the returnees is something out of the ordinary. What on earth is he trying to do?


"Are you watching?　Those damn foreigners who are after Japan's dungeon resources. They seem to be up to all sorts of schemes. ...... I won't let them get away with it. If they come, come at me head on, and I'll crush them as you wish."


　Dojima-san said to the camera as if he was trying to provoke it.

　Oh, so this is what he was aiming for.


　Japan is said to be a country of dungeons, with so many dungeons popping up all over the country.

　This means that there are a lot of dangers, but there are also a lot of resources to be gained. Thanks to this, other countries look up to us.


　However, because of this, there are many countries that target Japan. Dojima-san is not only dealing with dungeon problems, he is also dealing with those other countries.


　The reason he fought me was to show his power and check other countries.

　Minister Dojima's strength is well known, but I'm sure many countries would back off if they knew seven such people were getting together.


「Fucking foreigners lol. Too cool.」

「If I were an enemy country, I'd back off.」

「The Oni Dojima is still alive and well, isn't he?」

「I'm so excited that the returnees are gathering here, I wonder if some of them are coming who weren't publicized because they're underage.」

「...... didn't he just say that Shachiken is a returnee too?　Did I mishear?」

「Hmm?」

「What?」

「Ah.」

「Really?」

「Oh, yeah, that's what he said.」

「No way!」


"Ah."


　Dojima-san's voice leaked out as he looked at the comments.

　This guy......, did he just?


"Sheesh. This was a secret."


　Mr. Dojima slaps himself on the head inadvertently.

　Can we pretend he didn't just say that?　But this was a live stream. Naturally, there was no way to retract what he had said. Soon the comment section became noisy.


「Are you a returnee Shachiken!」

「You're one of the real heroes!」

「Too bad!」

「Awww, the guy who said it was processed!」

「Three returnees in the government, that's too bad. They're overpowered.」

「I feel sorry for the gaijin I'm dealing with.」

「Seriously, why were you a company employee?」

「I thought you might be one of them.」

「Tanaka!　I want to send you a spacha, please stream it!」

「Anti-san, you're getting overkilled!」


　The comments were so voluminous that it was hard to follow them with my eyes.

　At this rate, it's going to be all over social networking sites and online news again. ...... My head hurts.


"No, I'm really sorry, Tanaka. If that were the case, I will go poke all the viewers in the head and make their memories fly, okay?"

"What a thing to say, okay, you don't have to do that. You don't have to do that. You're an adult now, so there's no point in hiding it."

"I see!　I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The older you get, the looser you become."


　"Ha-ha-ha.", Dojima-san laughs.

　I said it's fine, but I'm sure it's going to make a big fuss again, maybe for a D-tuber, but I'm not too happy about the fuss.


“Hah ...... it's going to be messy again ......"


　I thought about the future and became depressed all by myself.
