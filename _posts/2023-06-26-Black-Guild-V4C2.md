　We walked into a nearby café under Hoshino's guidance.


"Hey look at those two ......."

"What?　Their faces are too small...... are they models......?"


　Hoshino and Rin drew a lot of attention both outside and inside the store. They're not only cute, but they're also very stylish. Since my appearance was exposed on social media, I've been doing so in public places.

　By the way, I was the only one who was not offered water at the restaurant because of this. I hate my attention manipulation skills at this moment.


"Hey. Order whatever you like. Don't hold back."

"Well, ...... then, can I have this 'Skytree Parfait Tyrant Dragon with Strawberry Flavor'......?"


　Hoshino chose a huge parfait that was as big as the Skytree.

　And the amount of toppings was worthy of the Tyrant Dragon name. The price was also dragon class. It was too much for me right now.


Hoshino seemed a little reserved when I asked her about the parfait.

　But it would be too lame to say, "Wait.......". I gave her a thumbs up and said, "Of course. Ask for whatever you like". It's hard to act like an adult.


"Which one do you want, Rin?"

"Well, at ......, I'll have the same thing as Hoshino-san's, but melon flavor."

"Ok, got it."


　Understood, I returned my presence and called for the waiter.

　After ordering theirs, I only ask for a cup of coffee. I like sweets, but I can't waste any more money.


"Rin-chan, you have amazingly beautiful hair, don't you?　Do you do anything special with it?"

"No, I don't do anything special. ......"

"Is it natural and so silky?　I'm so jealous!"


　The two were engaged in girlish talk.

　Before coming to the store, Hoshino started calling Rin "Rin-chan" and they got along fast. Rin was a little confused, but she was smiling happily from time to time.


　They are the same age and both are awakened people, so I guess they can relate to each other.


"By the way, I called you suddenly,......, are you okay?　Aren't you busy with the first division?"

"I'm sure they are. We are busy, but today is fine. We've had a lot of non-monster incidents lately, so it's possible that we'll have to be dispatched......."


　Rin answers my question.

　The first division of the defeat section is to deal with monsters. The police deal with ordinary thugs.


　However, this is not the case if the thugs are awakened people.

　Ordinary people, even if they are armed, cannot defeat an awakened person. In such a case, the Ministry of Monster Control, which has a large number of Awakened persons, is called upon to provide support.


　Recently, there have been suspicious religious groups that worship dungeons and radical political groups that demand that all dungeons be destroyed, so there is a lot of chaos. It's hard to imagine the strain on Dojima-san's heart to deal with all these people.


"It's hard work dealing with all those people, Don't push yourself too hard," 

"It's my job, you know. I can't whine about it."


　Rin said, reassuringly. She really has grown up to be reliable while I haven't seen her.

　While we were talking like that, a waiter came to us saying, "Sorry to keep you waiting!"  On the tray in his hand are two ridiculously large parfaits, each about 50 cm tall. What a huge parfait.......


"The Skytree Parfait Tyrant Dragon with Strawberry and Melon flavors!　Please be careful not to let them fall apart!"


　A huge parfait was placed in front of them.

　Hoshino said, "Wow!　It looks delicious!" and snapped a picture, while Rin held her spoon with her eyes glued to it, "Oh ......."

　If she was this happy, it was worth it to lighten her purse.


"Tanaka-san!　Can I eat it?"

"Of course. Don't hesitate to eat it."


　"Itadakimasu!" Hoshino looked as if she was about to eat a mound of whipped cream. Rin also said, "Itadakimasu!" as she nervously cut down the pile of parfait.


"It's delicious~♡♡"


　In contrast to Hoshino, who was saying how much she enjoyed each bite, Rin was silently putting the parfait in her mouth.

　She was eating as if she were in a food fight, and I was concerned.


"Rin, are you okay?"

"............Ah, I'm sorry. I got carried away"


　Rin noticed my words late and blushed a little shyly.

　I'm not sure what to do. I didn't know you liked sweets so much.


"I didn't know you liked sweets so much."

"When I was a trainee, I was forbidden to eat sweets, so it's not surprising. I eat it now and then,......, but it's the first time I've ever eaten something this big. I got a little carried away."


　The first division of the subjugation Unit has no one of the same sex who is close to the same age, so there is no opportunity to eat sweet things outside on holidays like this? Amatsuki is also busy and it would be difficult to go out together. I'm glad I was able to bring him along this time.


"I'm glad you liked it so much that you got hooked on it."


　As she said this and sipped her coffee, Hoshino said, "Oh," as if she had noticed something.


"I'm sorry I'm the only one who ate!　You want some too, don't you, Tanaka-san?　Please have some!"


　Saying that, Hoshino scooped up a bite of the parfait with a spoon and put it in front of me.

　It's what we call an "ah-nn". Suddenly, I stiffened.


"No, no, is it okay?　You don't have to force yourself......."

"I'm totally fine with it!　Just go ahead and do it!"


　Hoshino was confused, but she brought the spoon closer to me with firm determination.

　I'm sure Adachi and others will tease me about not getting upset over an indirect kiss, but it's too stimulating for me, a middle school graduate who has never had much contact with women in his life.


　I had a great experience with Amatsuki the other day, but I haven't fully digested it yet. The most important thing to remember is that you can't get used to it.


"Well, then,...... just a bite."


　Having made up my mind, I took a bite of the one that Hoshino offered me.

　It's a good taste. The balance of sourness and sweetness is just right. I calmly analyzed the situation, but my embarrassment won out over the deliciousness.


"How was it?"

"It was delicious. Very good."

"Hehehe, I'm glad to hear that."


　Hoshino smiles happily.

　As I'm thinking, "I can't do this again and again ......," another spoon is held out in front of me.


"Sensei, This one is delicious too."


　The first time I saw her, I was so excited.

　The pressure is great. I'm not sure if it's the same as Amatsuki's, but I'm not sure.


"No, but..."

"Here you go."

"...... okay"


　The first thing I did was to take a bite of the melon parfait that Rin offered me.

　Yes, this one is also very tasty. The sweetness of the melon combined with the sweetness of the cream makes my mouth very happy.


　It's good, but ...... it's still embarrassing.

　Especially since Rin is a student of mine, I'm not sure if it's really right for me to do this. Doesn't it make us look like a couple?


　When I looked at Rin with this thought in mind, she gave me a provocative look and licked the cream off the spoon.


　Hoshino, who was sitting beside me, couldn't see it, but I could.


"What's wrong Sensei?

"No, no, ...... nothing."

"Hmm, I see."


　Rin smiled thinly. Her cheeks were slightly reddish.

At this point, I remembered the last time I was with Amatsuki. No way they both think of me that way. Its impossible... Isn't it?


"No, but, but ......"


　I hold my head but I don't have an answer.

　You know, I was more comfortable when I was in a tie-up with Tyrant Dragon with no weapons.


"Tanaka-san. What happened to you?"

"Fufufu. I wonder. What's going on?"


　In the end, I agonized over this until they finished eating.
