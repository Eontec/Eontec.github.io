Tl: Sam

…

"These are some fine scales."


　I say as I look closely at the fixed sapphire dragon scales.

　When I lightly hit it with my fist, a high-pitched "kon" sound came out. Hmmm, it looks quite hard.


"It's a fine one, but it's not suitable for processing, so I'm keeping it. If I could crush it, I could use it as a knife or something."


　Kaoru-san said as she polished my sword.
<!--more-->     
　She was talking while she was polishing my sword, but her handiwork was superb. She is using the materials I gave her to repair and strengthen the sword.


"Then why don't you try first, Hoshino?"


　I waved to Hoshino, who looked most eager to try.


"Yes, I'd like to try!　Ah, I was also thinking, how about streaming this?　I'm sure everyone would enjoy it!"

"That would be fun. I never thought of that."


　Hoshino's suggestion caught my attention.

　She is a veteran streamer, so she has a lot of planning ability.


"But is Rin okay with being in the video?　If you don't like it, feel free to say no."

"No problem. I've been told by Minister Dojima to go to the media more to promote the Subjugation Division."

"I see. Thank you. I'll thank him again next time."


　Saying that, Rin shook her head in a firm and determined manner.


"Kaoru-san, are you okay with it?"

"Of course I'm fine. Please promote this store as much as you can. Recently, the number of customers has been decreasing because of the big weapon manufacturing companies."

"I understand. I will post the address of the store after the stream is over."


　Then there would be no viewers who would try to harass me during the stream.

　After getting approval from everyone, I took out the drone that I had left in my pocket.

　The battery is still in ....... Thank goodness it was loaded with high-capacity batteries.


"Okay, then, let's start streaming."


　I operate my phone and start the drone. I'm still nervous at this moment.

　After a few seconds of advertising the start of the stream on social media, people started trickling in.

　Now that the channel has over a million subscribers, I don't think it's possible for people not to show up, but it's still a relief when people show up properly.


「What?　You're starting a stream?」

「Wakotsu.」 (Tl: Internet slang in Japan for greeting live broadcasters and streamers too ig)

「Thanks for the stream.」

「Shachiken's here!」

「Tanaka!　I've been waiting for you!」

「I'm so happy for the stream!」

「I'm off work!」

「This is no time to be messing around lol!」


　The comments are soon heated up.

　I clear my throat, switch to working mode, and start talking to the drone.


"Thank you for coming in today. As the title says, today I would like to challenge you to slay the scales of the sapphire dragon in this store. By the way, this store I am visiting today is my favorite blacksmith store. I will post the location of this store when I am done streaming, so it would be great if you could come."


「Ok.」

「Ok.」

「k.」

「k」

「I'll definitely go there.」

「Drop some money, you guys!」

「If they're making weapons for Shachiken, they must be pretty trustworthy.」

「It's a lot easier to go on a stroll than to visit a dungeon.」


"And I have two people I know with me today."


　Saying that, I gestured to the two people in front of me who had been waiting behind the drone.

　First, Hoshino jumped in front of the drone.


"Hello!　I'm Hoshino Yui from Yui Channel!　I'm here today as a guest! Nice to meet you!"


「Yui-chan is here!」

「I'm glad to see that you and Shachiken are still going strong.」

「She's too cute as usual.」

「I'm too jealous of Tanaka who can do whatever he wants with those big breasts. ......」

「Don't worry, he hasn't made a move on her yet.」

「Get your hands on her, Tanaka!」

「Get your hands on me too, Tanaka!」

「As usual, the viewers here have a strange way of losing their temper.」


　The comments flow even faster when Hoshino is on the show. I'm glad to see that she's popular.

　Next, Rin steps out in front of the drone.


"Nice to meet you all. My name is Rin Ayakawa, I belong to the Ministry of Monster Control, Monster Subjugation First Division. I look forward to working with you."


「Who is this girl?　She's so cute!」

「She was in the government stream the other day. I'm glad to see her again!」

「Yui, the cute one, and Rin, the cool one, are a seamless lineup: ......」

「They're forming a harem lol. I'm so jealous.」

「Yui and Rin seem to get along well with each other. So cute.」

「I wonder how long she and Yui have been friends.」

「I want to breathe the air between them.」

「Too creepy. But I understand a little.」

「I wonder what Rin's relationship is with Shachiken?」

「I think she called him sensei or something in the government stream.」


　Rin is just as popular as Hoshino. It kind of makes me happy too.

　As I'm thinking this, Rin reads the holographic comments projected next to the drone and begins to answer questions.


"When I first joined the Subjugation Division, I was indebted to Makoto Sensei. He taught me so many things. I have not seen him for a while, but my respect for him has not changed. So our relationship has been longer than that of Hoshino-san."


「Shachiken, I didn't know you did that too.」

「The humidity in the way you look at Tanaka is too high.」

「You've already been captured, haven't you?」

「She's so cute, it's making my heart ache.」

「I'm having heart palpitations.」

「I like the heavy emotions of a cool, beautiful girl. It's good for all ailments.」

「She's mounting Yui, as usual.」

「This is a declaration of war, isn't it?」

「The First Wife War is about to begin.」 (Tl: Already won by Amatsuki)

「Take responsibility and get them all, Tanaka!」


　The comment section went wild.

　I hurriedly made a comment to Rin.

"Haha, you don't have to worry about how long we've known each other, do you?"

"Oh no,......, were the days when we were so intensely physical just for fun,......?" (Tl: Dojima thaught her well)

"No, that was just being challenged to a duel!　Don't say it in a way that could be misinterpreted!"


「I called the police.」

「That's a crime, isn't it?」

「Tanaka!　You're responsible for this!」

「It's getting interesting.」

「Yui, you're losing?」

「Shachiken is funny when he's flustered.」

「Sapphire Dragon Scales ............」

「Scale-kun, you've been completely forgotten about.」


　I desperately plead my case and managed to clear up the misunderstanding.

　It would be much easier to stream the dungeon. ......
