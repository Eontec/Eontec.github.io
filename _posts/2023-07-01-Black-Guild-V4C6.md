Tl: Sam

…

"Kaoru-san. I was able to cut the scales, so can I have the prize?"


　I talk to Kaoru-san, who is watching me as I sharpen my sword, having successfully slashed the scales. I was excited, wondering what on earth I would get. However, I was not sure what she was talking about,


"What are you talking about? I told you that I would give you a prize if you cut with a weapon.　No bare hands."
<!--more-->    
"What?　Is that even a thing?


　I was surprised by Kaoru-san's unexpected words.

　The comments were full of laughter, such as "lmao" and "surely". Just like with Dojima-san, adults are sneaky.


　As I was feeling down, Kaoru-san opened her mouth with a laugh and said.


"I'm just kidding. Don't take it seriously. I'll make blades out of the scales for the number of people in your party as an apology, so can you break them up a little finer?

"Are you sure you don't mind making one for the both of us?　Thank you!"


　I happily began crushing the sapphire dragon scales with my fist.

　These scales are difficult to process, but if I shatter them and attach a handle to them, they become a sharp knife. It is too small to be used as a main weapon, but it is easy to handle as an emergency weapon. I'm sure they'll both be glad to have it.


「Oh, Scale-kun is in pieces .......」

「You're crushing it with your fist, lol.」

「That's usually crushed by arm strength, right?　What was that about looking them in the eye?」

「I'm sure it can be crushed by arm strength as well, just because it's so easy to break. No, why can he crush it?」

「Scale: "let's meet again ...... you guys ......."」

「Scale-kun was a ...... good guy, although his hardness wasn't his best quality. ......」

「This was another divine episode. Thank God there were no surprises.」

「I think we're almost done with today's stream.」


　I crushed the scales into small pieces and placed them near Kaoru-san.

　Now, all I have to do is wait for Kaoru-san to finish her work. Now that there's nothing left to do, maybe it's time to cut the stream. I could do a chat stream, but I don't feel like I can expand the conversation too much.


　As I was thinking that, I suddenly heard a loud beep from Rin's phone!　A loud beep sounded from Rin's phone.


"It's ----!"


　Rin hurriedly pulls out her phone and runs her eyes over the screen.

　Then, as if with a grim look on her face, she suddenly takes off the clothes she was wearing.


「It's visible.」

「It's visible.」

「It's visible.」

「Watch.」

「REC.」

「Look.」


　The viewers lean forward.

　However, contrary to their expectations, she does not expose her skin. Underneath her clothes, the uniform of the First Defeat Section appears.

　Where in the world did she hide this under those clothes? Did she use some kind of quick-change magic?


"Sensei. I am sorry, but I must leave you here."

"What's the matter?　You were called?"

"Yes. I don't think I'll be able to come back today, so please enjoy the rest of the day with the two of you."


　Saying this, Rin walked towards the entrance of the store.

　Although she is trying to look calm, she seems to be in some kind of a hurry.


"What's wrong?　If it's an emergency, I can help you."

"No, I don't want to bother you, Sensei. Well then..."


　Rin opened the door and disappeared from the scene in an instant.

　Rin has always been one of the fastest of the awakened. Now she seemed to be even more polished.


　Rin is a first-class warrior. I don't think she's going to fall behind no matter what happens,......, but I have a bad feeling about this.  I'm worried.

　Security is not good these days, can we really leave her alone?


「What's going on, Rin?」

「What?　An incident?」

「Well, it seems there was some kind of commotion near the former Skytree site.」

「What?　Near the site?」

「It hasn't made the news yet, but people are talking about it on social media.」

「Oh my god. Rin, will you be okay?」


　If we are to believe the comments, it seems that something happened near the former Skytree site.

　That's why they called Rin who was near the site.


　If it's true, I'd like to go after her, but it's also bad to leave ...... Hoshino behind. I can't just do something that cruel to her.


　As I was wondering what to do, I suddenly got a push on my back.


"Eh ......?"


　When I turned around, I saw Hoshino there.

　With a somewhat uneasy smile on her face, she says.


"If you're worried about me...... I'll be fine; Please go."

"But ......."


　When I tried to argue with her, Hoshino shook her head and stopped me.


You're a hero to me, Tanaka-san. So I won't get in your way. Please take care of Rin-chan


　With that, Hoshino bowed her head.

　If she goes this far ......, I can't help but go.


"Tanaka!　Take this with you too!"


　Something suddenly flew toward me, spinning.

　I caught it and found it was my sword. Of course, it was Kaoru who threw it.


"Just as a princess needs a glass slipper, a prince needs a sword, right?　I took good care of it, so use it to your heart's content."


　Kaoru-san said with a manly smile.

　I pulled out half of the sword and checked the blade. With this, it seems I can cut anything.


　I bowed to Kaoru-san and said, "Thank you very much," and left the store.

　Naturally, Rin was nowhere to be found. Well, I've got to find her fast. ......
