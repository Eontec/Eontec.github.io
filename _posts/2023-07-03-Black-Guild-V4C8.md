「Oh no. That's really terrorism!」

「That's the Labyrinth Liberation Organization, right?　They're really going to do something like this?」

「That's crossing the line. ......」

「It's a real terrorist group, right? You guys are making fun of it, but it's a really bad organization, right?」
<!--more-->     
「I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a dungeon.　There was never a dungeon at the former Skytree site, was there?」

「Maybe it was newly created and the cult came here?」

「But how could they have predicted that a dungeon had been built?」

「Maybe the cult made that dungeon...」

「That's just not true, is it?」

「If that were true, the world would be in trouble.」

「Whatever the case, I'm glad Tanaka got there in time, thanks to the information from the viewers.」


　A drone streams the scene in stealth mode.

　Tanaka was a little hesitant about streaming the horrific scene, but streaming would allow him to deliver the situation on the ground to the government.

　Even if he messed up, if Amatsuki and Dojima knew about the scene, they would take care of it. That's what I thought.


"......"


　Tanaka remained silent and looked at the cult members.

　The air around the area was filled with a killing intent, and the air was cold and piercing.

　The leader of the group tried to look calm and spoke to Tanaka in a light tone of voice.


"Who are you ......?　It seems you are an acquaintance of the dog there."


　If he is an awakened person, he can do what I just did by twisting the blade of his sword while slashing bullets. This killing spirit was worrisome, but the leader still did not see Tanaka as that dangerous.


　When Tanaka did not answer his question, his subordinate cult member advised the leader.


"Leader. He is a D-tuber who has been the talk of the town lately. I think his name is Tanaka or something."

"D-tuber?　He's a fool who is mischievously exposing the inside of the labyrinth. Why is he here?"


　The leader, who had been concentrating on the project for some time, did not know Tanaka.


"It seems that ...... he is working with that Dojima. And I hear he's one of the returnees."

"Oh, that's wonderful. That's wonderful. I didn't know he had returned from our holy land."


　Hearing that he was a returnee, the leader became interested in Tanaka for the first time.

　The Imperial Palace dungeon was a special dungeon, a holy place, even for the cult. However, almost all of the returnees whose names had been revealed were allies of the government.

　However, if the returnees became their friends here, the morale of the Order would be boosted. The leader thought so.


"How about you, Tanaka?　How about you come with us!　If you do so, we will let the woman go!　As a returnee, you will be treated as an executive!"


　The leader confidently called out, but Tanaka's words made him even angrier.


"Don't play games with me. I'll never join you, no matter what terms you offer me."

"Well, ...... too bad."


　The leader then gives a command to his subordinates with a machine hidden in his hand.

　Then the cultist, who had been hiding in the rubble behind Tanaka, moves with a sharp sword in his hand. A member of the assassination squad, he jumps up without a sound and tries to thrust his sword toward the back of Tanaka's head.


「Tanaka!　Behind you, behind you!」

「Tanaka!」

「Tanaka!　Behind you!」


　The viewers called out in the comments, but Tanaka was oblivious because he had turned off his commentary screen.


"It's a shame."


　The leader, confident of victory, gloats behind the cloth.

　But Tanaka had noticed the presence of a man creeping up behind him. No matter how hard he tried to hide the sound of his footsteps, he could not completely muffle the sound of his garments rubbing against each other and his breathing.


　But knowing all this, he did not evade.


(It's over!)


　Confident of victory, the cultist thrust out his sword.

　The deadly blade came at him, cutting through the wind. The sword plunged straight into the back of Tanaka's head and shattered with a ...... sound.


"Eh ......?"


　The cult member let out a dumb voice.

　The sword he was holding in his hand was not so high grade, but still it was made from minerals from the dungeon. It cuts through rocks and iron on the ground like butter.


　It was hard to believe that such a sword could be shattered by a human body.


(Stupid ...... impossible!)


　The cult members were perplexed by the sensation left in their hands as if they were thrusting the sword into a huge rock.

　Then Tanaka turned around, held up the fingers of his right hand to form a "kan-te" shape, and drove it into the cult member's stomach with blinding speed.


"Gah ......!"


　It felt as if a real spear had been thrust at him.

　The impact twisted his internal organs and caused his spine to scream. The cultist, who had greatly exceeded his pain tolerance, easily let go of his consciousness and collapsed on the spot.


「Tsk tsk tsk.」

「Only Tanaka can win.」

「Sword-kun's in pieces, lol.」

「Why is the sword so fragile?」

「Shachiken is so strong」

「He's a strong, strong man who ate the Tsuyotsuyo fruit.」

「He crushed the scales of a sapphire dragon with his fist, so it would have to be a stronger weapon than that.」

「That's true.」

「The guys from the cult are so upset when they see that.」


"What the hell is that guy ......!"


　The leader of the cultists shuddered when he saw Tanaka's movement.

　These cult members are also training their bodies to realize their own ambitions. They pride themselves on taking their bodies to the limit by spending long hours in their own hidden dungeons, dabbling in dubious drugs, and so on.


　Tanaka's strength, however, far exceeded theirs.

　How many hardships did he have to overcome to reach this state? The leader was absolutely mortified.


　However, they could not admit defeat at this point. At the very least, they had to escape, for they had not yet achieved their noble goal.


"Don't move!　There are kids over here!"


　As the leader says this, a subordinate cult member shows the girl hostage to Tanaka.

　The cultist holds the girl's body down with his left hand and holds the gun in his right hand against his temple. Tanaka frowns when he sees this.


"A hostage. No wonder Rin fell behind."


　Tanaka, however, was not distraught by the appearance of the hostage and slowly put his hand on the sword at his waist.

　Then, a cult member saw this and shouted loudly,


"What the hell are you doing?　Don't you understand the situation?"


　The cultist pushed the gun further toward the girl.

　The girl was frightened and had big tears in her eyes.


　But Tanaka remained calm. He knew that if he got upset, he would be taken advantage of.


"Do you understand the situation? You're in my range. In other words, the situation between you and me is 50-50."


　The distance between Tanaka and the cultist was at least 20 meters. It was not a distance his sword could reach.


　But the cultist did not hear Tanaka's words as a bluff. It was as if a sword was pressed against his neck.


"You want to give it a try?　Which is faster, you pulling the trigger or my sword reaching you?"


　Tanaka said, lowering his back and assuming the stance of an iai.
