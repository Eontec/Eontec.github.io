Tl: Sam

…


　After safely defeating the suspicious people, I took a breath and said, "Phew."    
　I looked around for any sign of them, but there didn't seem to be anyone else hiding. I guess I could consider it safe for the time being.	 

As I was wondering what I should do now, Rin, who had sent the hostage girl to safety, came back to me.	 
<!--more-->    
"Sensei!"	 
"Whoa!"	 

　Rin jumped into my chest with all her might.  	 
　It was so fast that I was about to be blown away, but I caught it with my legs. If I were a normal person, my sternum would be shattered. 	 

"Sensei......Thank you......!"	 

　Rin was trembling as she buried her face in my chest.	 
　They took a hostage and had a gun pointed at her. The fear was immense. The emotions that had been suppressed were now overflowing.   	 

"I'm proud of you, You are indeed my proud student."    

　I continued to stroke her head until she calmed down.	 
　I felt really embarrassed because this was also being streamed, but right now it was more important to be there for Rin.

「It's so hot, isn't it?」    
「You're doing it again.」	 
「Tanaka!　Take responsibility!」    
「I really envy you. I wish I could switch places with you.」    
「It's true. I wish I could be hugged by Shachiken too!」    
「 Yeah, yeah!」
「Over there!」	 
「The audience is seriously turning into meth heads.」	 
「I can't tell if you're serious or not.」	 
「Maybe 40% of them are serious.」 	 
「There's a lot of them.」	 

　As I ignored the comments that were saying whatever they wanted, about five people appeared who were rushing toward me.   	 
　That outfit looks a lot like the one Rin is wearing. So are they from the Subjugation Division?  	 

　Rin noticed them approaching and quickly backs away from me, trying to look nonchalant.	 
　She was indeed embarrassed to be seen hugging me by her co-workers. Well, it was streamed all over the country. ...... I'll keep quiet about that. 	 

　The man who seemed to be the leader among the five came out in front of me. 	 
　He was a young man with a fearless face. He looked like someone I had seen before.	 

"It has been a while, Mr. Tanaka. I am Tsukasa Todo of the Subjugation Division. I had you train me before."   	 
"Oh, ...... is that right? It's been a long time, Todo-san."    

　I shook hands with the man who introduced himself as Todo.	 
　I don't remember each and every one of them since there were so many members that trained under me. I remember Rin because she got into trouble a lot and was very talented.	 

　As I recall, this Todo guy was not as strong as Rin, but he was strong. It seems he has grown up and is now working in the Subjugation Division.	 

"Thanks to your streaming, I understand the situation on the ground. I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving Ayagawa and the hostage girl. We will be sure to thank you for this later."	 
"I'm glad to hear that, but ...... I think it's better to think about dealing with that  now."	 

　I said this and turned my attention to the entrance to the dungeon that appeared at the site of the former Skytree. 	 
　I'm sure there wasn't anything like that when I came here this morning. Did the appearance of that thing bring those suspicious people here?　I'm thinking, They acted too fast for that, but then Rin overheard me and Todo-san.	 

"Actually......." 	 

　According to Rin's story, that dungeon was created by those suspicious guys earlier. I've never heard of people making dungeons.    
　It is not an easy story to believe, but there is no way Rin would lie about it. It must be true.  	 

　We decided to keep the fact that this is a man-made dungeon out of the conversation for now. If this fact were to spread through streaming, it would cause panic among many people. 	 
　It will eventually become known, but it doesn't have to be now.   	 

"When a new dungeon is discovered, the Labyrinth Management Bureau will be on hand to preserve and investigate. First, the entrance will be sealed, then ......." 	 

　As he was explaining this, Todo-san's expression suddenly hardened. 	 
　His eyes were filled with confusion and surprise. I wondered what was going on, and I looked at the entrance to the dungeon beyond his gaze. 	 

　Then I learned the reason for his surprise. 	 

"...... Really?" 	 

　A small slime came out of the dungeon, bouncing around.	 
　It was an ordinary slime with no special abilities. It was rank E, the weakest of all the monsters.    

　But that's not the problem.	 
　The problem is that the monster came out of the dungeon. This is out of the ordinary.	 

「Did that slime come out of the dungeon?」	 
「No, that can't be true ......, seriously?」	 
「Yeah, why!　You're lying!」	 
「Are you kidding me?　I live in the next block!」	 
「No. It's scary!」	 
「It's a monster disaster!　I have to get out of Tokyo!」 	 
「This sucks!」 	 

　The comments quickly turned into a snarl.   
　I swung my sword at high speed, sending a shockwave and knocking down the slime, but the chaos didn't stop anymore. That's how crazy it is to have monsters out there. 	 

"A 『Unique Dungeon』 of all things. ......"

　I swear, things are so bad.    
　Right now, only weak monsters were showing up, but if we let things continue as they are, stronger and stronger monsters will be coming out of the dungeons.
　I can't believe such a dungeon would appear in the heart of the city. Even if I don't like it, I remember the time when the Imperial Palace dungeon was born.	 

"No. ......"	 

　It was Rin who let out a small voice.  	 
　Her pretty face turned blue, and her eyes were filled with deep despair and fear.	 

　Rin lost her parents in a monster disaster when she was a small child. She must be remembering that time.	 

　...... I can't just leave this dungeon like this, can I?

"Todo-san. Can I destroy this dungeon?"	 
"Eh, Eeehhhh!?　It is true that this dungeon is dangerous, but ...... I have no right to give you that permission. I am sorry ......."	 

　Todo-san apologetically lowered his eyes.
　Dungeons are valuable resources. Destroying it without permission is strictly prohibited by law. No matter what the reason, breaking it would make me a criminal.	 

　However, I could not sit idly by and watch Rin in this state.    
　I could go under the radar, prepared to get caught, but that would make Rin feel responsible.	 

　I was wondering what I should do.	 
　I looked around and thought about what might be useful, and then I saw a drone streaming on and came up with an idea.	 

"If it's that guy, he's on ......!"    

　I operated my phone and brought the drone close to me. 	 
　Then I spoke into the camera.  	 

"Mr. Dojima, I'm watching this feed, aren't I? You are watching this stream, aren't you?　If you're watching, please comment."	 

「Eh?」   
「What's up with you all of a sudden, Tanaka!」 	 
「I'm preparing to run away, but I'm also curious about the stream.」 	 
「Are you watching, Minister?」	 
「Yes, yes! Are you watching, Minister Dojima?」	 
「What's going on?」	 
《Ministry of Monster Control Official》「Oh, you got it, huh? Oh, how did you know? I'm watching you perfectly.」	 
「Why is he the minister now?」	 
「What?」	 
「He's really watching us.」 	 
「What?」  	 
「That was weird.」	 
「Don't look at it on the official account.」 	 
「I can't believe I'm seeing a collaboration between Minister Dojima and Shachiken again.」  	 

　I found the Ministry of Monster Control's account among the comments flowing, and I smile.	 
　I knew this person would definitely be watching me.    

　He must have understood what I wanted him to do, and he must be working on it.	 

"I'm going to destroy this dungeon now. Please give me permission."    
"Who are you talking to? I'll take all the responsibility, so just go."	 

　Dojima-san responded quickly to my request, as if he had been prepared for it.
