Tl: Sam

…

　I ran up the wall and approached Rin.

　The surface of the tentacle slime is sticky unlike that of ordinary slimes. This mucus is not harmful, but it is a hindrance when slashing.


　If you use a sword with poor sharpness, it slips on the surface and you cannot cut it. My sword had just been sharpened by Miss Kaoru, so that won't happen to me.
<!--more-->

"Rin, I'm coming!"

"Sensei ......!　No, don't worry about me.......!"


　Rin, after seeing me, began to put all her strength into her body.

　Her body then began to be charged with electricity. She was converting the magic essence in her body into electricity.


"Emission ...... lightning!"


　Fierce lightning gushed out from Rin's entire body.

　The tentacles of the tentacle slime that had grabbed her were struck by it, and they writhed in agony. Slime species tend to be generally vulnerable to lightning attacks.

　That one must have hit it pretty hard.


『――――！！』


　The tentacle slime, with some of its tentacles burned off, retracted its tentacles into the hole. Then Rin, who was trapped, was thrown into the air.

I immediately kicked off the wall and caught the freed Rin in mid-air. I was a little embarrassed because I was holding her like a princess, but I held on.


"Nice attack."

"Thank you, ...... Sensei."


　Rin looked a little tired, but she was fine without a scratch. So, I think we could continue the battle without any problems.

　If there was a problem ...... it would be the sticky mucus on our clothes. I don't think it's going to be too much of a problem, but I'm having trouble finding a place to put my eyes.

"Sensei? Is something wrong?"

"No, no, Nothing."


　I turned my head away from Rin, who asked me at close range, looking into my face.

　It's no good. If you have evil feelings toward your students, you're not a qualified teacher.. I must think of Four Character idioms to calm my mind. Shintou doroku shiroto kozoku yakiniku teishoku: ...... [^1]


「It's rare to see Shachiken being embarrassed.」

「If you push him, you'll get it!」

「I can't see Rin well because Tanaka is in the way!」

「I can't see!」

「 can't see!」

「Has Tanaka been covered in mucus yet?」

「Who's benefit is that?」

「What?　I deserve it. （I want to see it.)」

「I want to see it too.」

「Me too.」

「I think so, too」

「I knew it, you're all perverts!」


　After calming myself down, I first removed the mucus from my shoulders and cheeks with my bare hands.

　I shook my hand at high speed and used the wind pressure to remove the mucus from my hands. I was very careful not to hit Rin.


"Thank you, Sensei. Um, I'm sorry, but may I ask you to ...... help me as well?"


　Saying that, Rin brought her chest closer.

　They had grown bigger than they were when she was a child, and of course there was a lot of mucus.


「Rin-chan attacking aggressively lol.」

「She's fallen, I'm sure of it.」

「She's too clever.」

「She's leading the heroine race!」(Tl: Tch, Tch, not true)

「Yui's spiritual pressure is ...... gone ......!」

「Aggressive Ayagawa.」

「She's so good!」 

「What are these guys doing in a dangerous dungeon?」

「Remove it properly」


　I froze at Rin's unexpected suggestion.

　This is ...... not good. I could feel the threads of my rationality tearing with a banging sound.

　I couldn't calm down even if I thought of a Four Character phrase. I make a fist and smash the right side of my head with a hard thud!　


「Hiee!」

「Hee」

「What?」

「 He suddenly punched himself lol.」

「It sounded like iron colliding with iron.」

「Well, I'm sure his head and fists are harder than steel.」

「Don't concentrate like you're fixing an old appliance.」


　...... Okay, the annoyance is gone.

　With a quick wave of my hand, I removed the mucus from Rin's chest. Mission accomplished.


"Is everything okay now?"

"......Yes. Thank you."


「Rin, you're so cute when you sulk.」

「He got rid of his troubles by brute force, didn't he?」

「But this is only a matter of time.」

「Why are we having a heroine race in a unique dungeon (joy)?」


　I manage to get over the biggest crisis and look at the wall.

　The main body of the Tentacle Slime must still be alive. If we began to fall, there's a chance it would attack us again. It would be better to take it down firmly.


　I put down Rin, who I was holding in my arms, and tapped the wall with the back of my hand.

　Hmmm, this way?


"Sensei, what are you doing?"

"Oh, I'm looking for slime. When you tap like this, you can tell what's going on inside by the echo."


　When I explained this, Rin imitated me, but she didn't seem to understand what I was talking about.

　everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.


「He's doing sonar-like things himself, this guy.」

「Tanaka's seriously not human.」

「What can't this guy do?」

「Rin-chan is so confused.」


　I banged on the wall a couple of times while the comments were going wild, and found the main body of the Tentacle Slime.

　Then I went near the part and slapped the wall as hard as I could.


"Yo, tsu."


　A shockwave travels through the wall and hits the main body of the tentacle slime.

　The tentacles of the Tentacle Slime can be cut many times, but the main body is fragile. The nucleus was torn to pieces by the single blow just now.


　The main body of the tentacle slime came out of the hole, but its body was so limp that it collapsed and died as soon as it came out.


" All right. That worked."


「Instant kill, lol.」

「Didn't you know?　You can't escape Tanaka.」

「I feel sorry for the monster.」

「So scary lol.」

「Now they can go down there.」

「I was scared when I saw the unique dungeon, but after watching this stream, I feel a bit relieved.」

「I guess this stream is the reason why the panic isn't as widespread as I thought it would be.」

「Indeed.」

「The number of people who have watched this stream is over 100 million again, and a lot of people from overseas are watching it.」

「We still don't have 11.9 billion people watching, do we?　I'm sure it's going to grow even more in the future.」

「The D-tube has an automatic translation function, so it's easy for people from other countries to watch.」

「He's really great!　I wish they would deploy him in the US!」 (English)

「Sorry. This corporate slave is for Japan.」

「If a foreign country NTRs me, I'll never get over it.」(Tl: Simple terms, steal yo girl)


　I realized that the number of viewers had exceeded 100 million.

　I haven't seen this much growth since that time I streamed by mistake.


　I was happy that more people are watching, but it was no time to be happy. I had to destroy this dungeon as soon as possible.


"We've spent quite a bit of time on this. Shall we hurry?"

"Yes, let's go."


　Rin and I nodded to each other and fell back into the deep abyss.

[^1]: Theyre Four Character Phrases/idioms, phrases (usualy but not always idiomatic) that have four characters (exists in both Chinese and Japanese). The ones here mean, in order: Clear the mind, All is vanity, but the last one is a little complicated, and has some history. It translates literally to A BBQ set meal, But is a parody on another Four Character Phrase that meant, “The weak are a meal for the strong”(Which is a very great quote), but two characters in the spelling have been replaced to give it its more tasty meaning 焼肉定食 -> 弱肉強食. The common urban legend is that a student answered 焼肉定食 instead of the intended answer 弱肉強食, when he was asked to fill the blank in the following phrase □肉□食. Took me quite a while to get
