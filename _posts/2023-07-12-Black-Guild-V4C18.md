Tl: Sam

…


「Yes!　Shachiken won!」

「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」

「Shoggoth-kun ......, we lost a great guy.」

「Stay tuned for what's next for Shoggoth-kun」

「No, this is seriously bad. The U.S. and other countries are spending a lot of money to contain shoggoths in dungeons, and if someone ...... is able to defeat them individually, the countries will move in.」
<!--more-->   
「I am a victim of shoggoth. I feel saved, thank you (English).」

「I'm really glad Tanaka was there. If Shoggoth had come out, Tokyo would have been destroyed.」

「Thank you, Tanaka!　Thank you so much!」

「I'm in the neighborhood, so I was really worried. I was really nervous because I live in the neighborhood, but I thought I'd be okay because Shachiken was there.」

「Thanks also to Minister Dojima, I'm sure he'll say a lot of things in the Diet and at the press conference, but I'm rooting for him!」

「He has a very high approval rating, so I'm sure he'll be fine, no one else can minister there.」


　After safely defeating Shoggoth, I take a deep breath.

　I was a little nervous because it was my first time fighting it, but I guess I did well. The comments were also very positive.


"...... Nn?"


　Suddenly, my feet shook, and the whole dungeon made a rumbling sound.

　It seems that the dungeon core was the right one that I broke earlier.


　When the core breaks, the dungeon breaks and returns to the state it was in before the dungeon was created. I haven't figured out the principle yet, but the loss of the dungeon doesn't cause subsidence.

　I really don't know how it works.


"Wow, I have pieces of shoggoth on my clothes."


　I noticed a black gooey substance on the belly of my suit.

　The other goo had dissolved when I killed Shoggoth, but for some reason this one was still there.


　I tried to brush it off with my hand, but it was stuck so tightly to the suit...... that I couldn't get it off.

　I need to get out of here and leave it alone for the time being. I'll just wash it in the washing machine and it will come off.


"Tekeri, ri." (Tl: Shoggoth is an actual character confirmed, my deduction skills are impeccable, might as well call me Sherlock)

"Uh-huh?"


　I suddenly heard a shoggoth-like voice and looked around, but couldn't find anything moving.

　Is it an auditory hallucination?　Shoggoth has the ability to pollute the mind, so maybe I've been affected by it. Maybe we should get checked out when we get back.


"Well, we've got to get out of here first. If we stay in there, we'll be flattened."


　The dungeon attack ends when we get out of here.

　I ran up to Rin, who was watching the battle behind me.


"We need to get out of here, can we go?"

"......, yes!　Of course!"


　Rin looked at me for a moment and then went back to her normal self.

　Well, we faced an EX-ranked monster. It's natural to be nervous.


「Rin-chan, you've fallen in love with him again, haven't you?」

「You're so cute with your red face.」

「This Uncle's heart is pounding!」

「My heart is palpitating!」

「Why doesn't he just push her down!　She's waiting for it! (English)」

「I'm sure you're not the only one who's sensitive.」

「I'm not sure how to translate “insensitive" into English, but I'm not sure.　I'll send you a separate comment with @." (Tl: This is comedy gold, so I'll add some of the raws here so you can get it)

「I think it's 'insensitive'.」 (「insensitiveらしい」)

「He's very, very insensitive, okay?」 (「ヒーイズベリーベリーインセンシティブ、オーケー？」)

「Lmao.」

「I can't tell if you're competent or incompetent」 (Tl: Competent cuz he actually translted it to english. Incompetent, cuz then why katakana if you already literally have the english words?)

「Why are you using katakana?」

「Oh my god. ｜Now I understand.」

「You understand everything lol.」

「I have a translator, so send it to me in Japanese!」


　The dungeon was shaking violently, and Rin and I ran toward the hole we fell into.

　On the way there, Rin grunted in pain.


　Rin was covering her right leg as she ran. It seems that she had sustained some damage in the battle with Shoggoth.


"Rin, that leg ......"


　The hem of her right leg has melted and the skin underneath has turned red.

　It looks like Shoggoth's splattered mucus has snagged it. My skin is a little tougher than other people's, so I'm fine, but it would be a serious injury to a normal person.

　I'm trying to be patient, but it must hurt a lot.


"I'm fine with this kind of injury. I can't bother you, Sensei......"

"No, no. I'm not just going to say, "Well, then you're fine". I'm glad you want to show me how much you've grown, but ......"


　When I approached Rin, I took the opportunity to hold her in my arms.

　The form is what is known as a "princess hold". Rin was surprised and screamed, "Kya!"


"I want you to rely on me more freely. Teachers are creatures who want to be depended on by their students."

"Sensei ......"


　Rin seemed to understand what I was saying and stopped resisting.

　Okay, now we're ready to escape.


「We're attacking again, ma'am.」

「Rin, you look too happy and cute.」

「Let's set up the wedding hall here.」

「［¥30000］Here's your wedding gift money.」

「Finish with a happy kiss.」

「I wish I could have been a student of Shachiken.」

「［¥50000］Is this where we're going to have our spacha timing today?」

「［¥56000］My bank account is on fire!」

「You guys are so generous. I'll pay it when they’re really married.」

「[$30000] What is it?　You want me to give you some money? (English)」 (Tl: The amount blew me away..)

「Gaijin niki!」 (Tl: Basically, a half slur meaning something like 'Foreign Brother')

「$30,000 lmao.」

「This is a thank-you Spacha party!」


"Wow, something is going on with Spacha."


　Red letters fly wildly in the comment section, which is being shown on a three-dimensional image.

　In no time at all, the amount of money piled up to exceed my annual livestock income, and I stood scared before my joy. No, I'm grateful, but I wasn't sure if I should be getting this much.


"Well, thank you to all of my viewers. If I were to do a thank you stream somewhere......  a wedding?　A congratulatory gift?　What are you talking about ......?" (Tl: He had to do a double take reading those comments)


As I was being dumbfounded by the meaningless comments, a large number of slimes were falling down from the hole above my head!

　It seems that the vibrations caused them to fall.


　When the slimes saw me, they jumped and shook their bodies, threatening me.

　It seems that they considered me an enemy.


"tto ....... I've been a little too distracted by the comments. I'll get out of here as soon as I can. Hold on tight."

"Yes, sir. Please."


　Rin clung to my body tightly.

　The soft touch and the good smell of her body almost made my rationality jump out of my skin, but I held on with my steel mentality.


"Then, let's get the hell out of here."


　I kicked away the slimes that attacked me and began to escape from the dungeon.


......


Tl Note: Early Release cuz I'm not going to class today, and had to do something while i procastinate packing up my stuff
