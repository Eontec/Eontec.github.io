"Monsters born in dungeons are usually not supposed to be friendly to humans. This is probably a world first. The world will be surprised again."


　Dojima-san laughs happily as he says this.

　I knew that this was quite unusual, so I hadn't told anyone else about it yet. Adachi, Hoshino, and Rin didn't know about it either. Even now, I did it just as the waiter went to get more meat.
<!--more-->   

"I've heard that some foreign countries are researching the use of monsters, but all of them have failed. I never thought I'd see a successful example of it in my own neighborhood."

"What do you think we should do about this guy?　That's what I wanted to ask you today, Dojima-san".

"Well,......, I don't feel any strong power from what I've seen.  It should be easy to 'exterminate' him."


　Dojima-san said as he observed Shoggoth, and then added, "But..."

"That would be boring. This is a great opportunity to learn about monsters. It's not in my nature to be selfish. Leave it to me, and I'll shut up the other senators and the media who are trying to exterminate it."

"Thank you very much. Thank you for all the trouble I've caused you."

"Ha-ha-ha, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It's the old man's job to be bothered by the young."


　A week ago, I noticed Shoggoth at home, tucked into my suit pocket.

　He has been living with me at home ever since, and after a week I began to feel affection for him, as I do for my pets. I was relieved that I didn't have to get rid of it.


"Even so, that dungeon must have been special in some way. I wonder where they got the seeds to make the dungeon."

"You don't know that yet, do you?"

"No. They don't know anything important. They were the last members of the group who didn't know anything important. They were disposable."


　All of the members of the Labyrinth Liberation Organization who went on the rampage in the city were captured.

　They are still being held under tight custody and interrogation, but the results do not seem to be good.


"Once the dungeon was created, Shoggoth would destroy the city. In other words, once they create the dungeon, the job is done. The operation should have been a great success. Unfortunately, it failed because Tanaka was nearby."


　It is true that if that thing had gone out into the city, it would have caused catastrophic damage.

　I am so glad we were able to defeat it before it went outside. If we had made a mistake, it would have been the second coming of the Imperial Palace Great Demon Disaster.


　As I was thinking that, the door opened and the waiter came back.

　I hurriedly covered Shoggoth, who was wiggling around on the table, with both hands to hide him.


"Is something wrong?"

"No, no, nothing. Nothing. ...... ha ha."


　I was sweating and became very confused.

　Then Dojima-san quickly offered a helping hand.


"Ume-chan, I'm going to grill the meat over here, so it's okay if you go back. I have something I want to talk to him about."

"Yes...... understood."


　The waiter walked out of the private room with a curious look on his face.

　It was a close call.


"It's not a good idea to keep it a secret. It would be better to let people know about it as soon as possible through streaming or other means. If the number of fans increases, public opinion will be on our side. It will also make it easier for me to protect it."

"I understand. I will introduce it to the audience in the next stream."


　I cooked the meat and put it in my mouth.

　Aah ...... delicious. I'm not going to be able to come here that often, so I'm going to save some food for later.


　As I was thinking that, Shoggoth was staring at me with a discontented look on his face.

　Then, with his short, caterpillar-like arms and legs, he suddenly took hold of his own buttocks, tore it to bits, and presented it to me.


"Riri!　Riri!"

"...... Tanaka. What is he doing?"


　Dojima-san tilted his head curiously when he saw this series of actions.

　I've seen this behavior many times before, so I understand it, but the first time you see it for the first time, you'll have no idea what's going on.


"Uh, let's see, he's jealous of the food."

"Hmm?　Can you be more specific?"

"He doesn't like it when I eat something that looks good, so he offers himself up to me like this, like he wants me to eat him. It seems to be his way of expressing his love."


　I picked up the meat offered by Shoggoth and ate it.

　It still doesn't taste good. But I feel like it's getting closer and closer to a level where it's humanly edible. Maybe I've gotten used to it, or maybe Shoggoth is changing the taste, or maybe both.


　When Shoggoth saw that I had eaten it, he let out a happy, high-pitched "Riri♡".


"......What an unusual expression of affection, isn't it?"


　Dojima-san says with a hint of reluctance.

　Maybe I'm crazy for eating it in a normal way. Maybe I've eaten so much monster food that I've become numb to it.


"Speaking of expressions of affection...... who will you choose in the end?　Amatsuki?　Or Ayagawa?"(Tl: Asking the important questions)


　At Dojima-san's sudden words, I spewed out the beer I was drinking.

　What is this old man talking about?

"I watched the stream all the way through. I used to have a sweet and sour love in the past. I was hoping that we'd get together sooner or later, but here we are. Moving forward, so which one will it be?"

"I don't know. I never thought I would fall in love with anyone."


　I, who had my heart crushed as a company employee, could never think of dating anyone.

　Recently, many people have recognized me and I finally have the time to think about my own happiness, but I still haven't recovered enough to think about love.


"Hmmm. Well, it's nothing urgent, ...... but I'll tell you one thing. I consider both Amatsuki and Ayakawa as if they were my own daughters. If you do anything to make either one of them cry, you won't get away with it."

"......, isn't that a dead end?"


　I think the two of them are very special and important to me. I don't want to do anything that will make them cry either.


"Ha-ha-ha!　Don't think too much about it!　And if you can't choose one or the other, just make them both happy!　I'm not like those old people, I don't have old values!"

"Well, ......, I'll think it over."

"Yeah, that's fine. Come on, let's have a new drink. Sake?　Ume-chan, sake!　Sake!"


　Dojima-san called the waiter in a loud voice.

　Today's fun drinking session continued until late into the night.
