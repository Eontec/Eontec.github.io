…


"Tekeri?"



　Shoggoth seemed to be curious about the drone and got close to it, staring closely into the lens.

　Naturally, the viewers were excited to see Shogos' image filling the delivery screen.



「Holy shit, it's over here ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！」 
<!--more-->   
「Shogotan, look at me!」

「Gawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!」

「Ha, ha, Shogotan kawaii yo ......!」

「My heart is starting to get a little excited.」

「I've already seen illustrations of anthropomorphic Shogotan on social networking sites.」

「She'll be a brown downer yandere bishoujo when she becomes a person!」

「I'm too happy with my sexuality. More of this.」

「Sure, she's cute, but isn't it scary that there's a ...... monster in town?」

「What are you, anti-monsters?」

「There's no guarantee that they won't attack people, so I can understand why you're scared.」

「There's no way Shogotan would attack people!　You've got to be kidding me ！！１１１」



　The comments were starting to get kind of rough.

　The cause was a comment from someone who was afraid of monsters.



　This person had a valid point. If they were kept in a facility somewhere, I would be worried, but if they were kept by an ordinary person like me, I would be worried too.



　Naturally, I discussed this with Dojima-san.



"It is natural that you are worried. Shoggoths are monsters, and there is no guarantee that they will never attack people. But I will not let that happen. If he tries to attack anyone, even a little, I will cut him down. I promised that to Dojima-san as well, and he gave me permission to keep them."



　I said, stroking Shoggoth's back with my index finger.

　Even without such a promise, Dojima-san gave me permission to keep him, but this is my way of apologizing. It pains me to cut down this guy who is so compassionate, but I can't keep a monster with half a mind.



「It's safe, then, isn't it?」

「You're so ready for this.」

「I guess it's safer for Tanaka to keep an eye on him than to lock him up.」

「Well, well, if that's the case with someone as powerful as you, ......」

「You're so sweet when they talk about cutting you down, you're so cute.」

「Well, I can understand your fear, but there is no such thing as a friendly monster in the world, and it would be a shame to get rid of a valuable research subject.」

「That's right. I think the whole world is planning to kidnap Shogotan right now.」

「If it wasn't for Tanaka's side, I'm sure she'd be kidnapped in a heartbeat.」



　Phew, the comments have calmed down somehow.

　This should be fine as long as Shoggoth doesn't cause any problems. Fortunately, Shoggoth is smart and listens to me. I don't think they'll attack anyone else.



「By the way, doesn't Shogotan have a name?　No, Shogotan would be fine, but Tanaka wouldn't call me that.」

「Sure, I want a name.」

「I'd like a cute name.」

「Tanaka!　Pick a name!」



　...... name, huh? I certainly hadn't thought about it.

　It is better to have a name in order to get along well with others. But I'm not good at thinking of such things.

　I think desperately with my head.



"Ummm......... Shogosuke, Shogozura?

"Teke......."



「Too bad you have no naming sense.」

「Shogosuke lmao.」

「Shogotan is so confused.」

「Your naming sense is worse than Shoggoth!」

「Sorry, he's a muscle gorilla. He’s not good with that kind of thing.」

「Shachien is too cute!」

「Tanaka!　Shogokura is really not it!」



　The criticism was thunderous.

　I was aware that I had no sense of style, but I was depressed when I was told so much. ......

　There is an option to ask for a name from the audience, but the name is a living thing and I want to give it to myself.



　For the moment, I've learned that "shogo + kanji" is lame, so let's think of another pattern. I'll think of something else, like the way it looks or ...... the sound it makes. Let's get inspiration from such things.



"If I take it from its appearance, I'll go with 『 Kuro 』?　It's not a bad name, but it sounds a bit dog-like. 『  Chibi  』 because of its small size...... would also be too easy. It could grow up to be big. If I were to take 『   Teke 』 from its squeak, would I call it 『    Teke  』?　No, it's hard to call it that. If we take it from another pattern, maybe 『     Riri   』?"

"Riri!"



　Shoggoth's voice comes out in response to the last name candidate I mentioned.

　Apparently she likes this one.



「Riri, huh, that's nice.」

「Finally, we've got a good one.」

「I'm going to go make a Riri-chan fan club.」

「Fugurui!　Riri! Riri!　Riri! (language my brain refuses to understand)」

「I love it!」

「Are you selling Riri-chan merchandise yet? (Gobbling).」



　The viewers' reactions were also favorable.

　I'm glad I managed to come up with a satisfactory name. I feel like I've done a great job.



　While I'm looking tired like that, Riri shred her own tail and offers it to me. It seemed that she was showing her appreciation for my efforts.



"Thank you, I'll take it."

"Riri!"



　I eat a piece of Lili's tail with a flip of my hand.

　The first time I ate it, it was crunchy, but now it's much smoother.



「Yes!　You're eating it?」

「She's offering it to him lol.」

「She's too devoted!」

「They say Shoggoths are a serving race, but ...... you're serving too much.」

「She's happy to see herself being eaten.」

「Grabbing his stomach (physical) (inside).」 

「She’s just like ampanman in the way she expresses her love.」(Tl: Anime character with a bean bun(anpan) for his head that feeds injured people part of his head, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpanman))

「Why is Shachiken eating normally too (dumbfounded)?」

「A self-cutting heroine, huh, ......, that's new.」

「Eek.」

「It's really bad. It's so perfect for my sexuality.」

「I want to eat Riri, hahaha...」

「It's going to melt your stomach.」

「You guys are so good together.」

「Why am I getting so many great clips at a home delivery?」



　When I ate the Riri, the viewers got a big kick out of it.

　It's like my senses were numbed because I eat it on a regular basis. Is it a shocking sight for normal people?



　Well, it's okay, because they seem to be happy. Riri seems to have been liked by a lot of people.



"All right, let's see if I can show you some of the tricks I've been working on. Sit down and make a move!"

"Riri!　Riri!"

"Another one!　Tentacles!"

"Teke!　Ri!"　



「Gyaaah!　Tentacles!」

「Tentacle heroine, huh?」

「Traffic jam of attributes.」

「Ehhhhhh!」

「I can't wait to shake hands with her!」



　And so Riri's delivery proceeded with great success.
