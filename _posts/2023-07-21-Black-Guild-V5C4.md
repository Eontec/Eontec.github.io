"Tanaka, gosujin goshujin."



　To my surprise, Riri was able to speak at least simple word combinations.

　Did she understand what I was saying by listening to me?　You're learning too fast. I think the day when she can speak fluently may be near.

"I'm hungry."

"You ate a while ago."

"Moo."



　Now that he's learning words, she's becoming more assertive.

　I have to be careful not to spoil her too much.



"The exchange is too cute."

"If it were me, I'd feed her endlessly and fatten her up......"

"I'm sure the feedings alone will bring in 100 million in the same session!"

"I'm going to use the money I get from that stream to buy food and feed it in a stream and complete the ...... perpetual motion machine."

"I also wanted to be called 'Gosujin' by Lili-tan for the rest of my life. ......"

"［\20000］goods......Please give me some Riri-tan merchandise.....(earnestly)."

"I have two hearts - one that wants to be kept by Tanaka and one that wants to be eaten by Lilitan......"

"It's getting pretty much boiled down to the perverts, isn't it?"



　Well, now that we have one last place to get excited, it's time to stop the stream. I'm getting hungry too. I want to eat my own food outside of the stream.



"Well, it's a good point, but it's time to go, so I'll end today's delivery at this point. I'll be posting Riri's progress on social networking sites, so I'd appreciate it if you could follow me there as well. Thank you very much for your time today."



"Otsuken!"

"Thank you for your hard work!"

"I had a great time today!"

"Otsu Riri!"

"Please deliver Riri again!"

"I'll be waiting for you with chururu!"

"I'm looking forward to the next dungeon stream!"



　As the comments flowed in, I pressed the end button.

　Then I checked again three times to make sure I didn't forget to turn it off. I'm afraid of forgetting to turn off the feed, so I check it like this every time.



"I'm afraid I'll forget to turn off the delivery, so I check it like this every time. I'm glad it went well. Thank you, Riri."

"You're welcome!"



　Lili replied cheerfully.

　She is back to her squeaky voice again.



"......nn?　You have a message."



　I opened my phone and noticed that I had received a message.

　The sender was Hoshino. I looked inside and saw that it was an invitation for a joint stream.



　Come to think of it, I haven't seen Hoshino since the incident at the Skytree site.

　I thought a joint stream might be a good idea to make up for that time.



"I had some time left before the dungeon search that Dojima-san asked me to do, so a joint stream might be just what I needed."



　I sent an e-mail agreeing to the joint stream.

　Within a minute, I received a reply. Young people are so quick to reply.



 "It said 『 Well, thank you very much, I'd like to discuss the details with you, so if you'd like, please come to my house. 』 ......?



　I was wide-eyed and surprised at the unexpected invitation.

　It seems that Hoshino's younger brother and sister are my fans and they want to meet me.



　She also wants to treat me to a meal as a token of her appreciation.

　I'm glad to hear that, and I'd like to meet Hoshino's younger siblings. But is it safe for someone like me to go to a girl's house?



　The last time I went to a girl's house was when I was in elementary school. I have sadly little experience.



"What do you think, Riri?"

"Tekke?"



　Riri tilted her head as if she didn't understand.

　She was about the age of a four-year-old human in terms of intelligence.　She can understand simple words, but she doesn't seem to understand complex things. Even so, she is growing up too fast.



"U ~~ n.  Well, let's go. It would be bad to refuse."



　After much conflict, I decide to go and send a message to Hoshino.

　Then again, the reply came in a flash.



"What is it?　『 Thank you very much. How about tomorrow afternoon? 』 Well, there's nothing to do tomorrow."



　I agreed, and we exchanged a few more messages after that to set up a more detailed time.

　After successfully exchanging messages, I let out a sigh of relief and threw my phone under the covers.



"......I'm getting nervous even after all this time. I'm not sure if it's really okay for me to go to a girl's house.　I'm not sure if I smell like old age or not. Do you think you'll be okay?"

"Riri?"



　To my question, Riri only tilted her head and didn't answer me.


....
