…


"Itadakimasu!"

　we said, clasping our hands together as we sat down at the dining table.   
　In front of us, there was a lineup of hot rice, miso soup, fried chicken, rolled egg, salad, etc.

　It had been about 10 years since I had eaten such a home-cooked meal. I was somewhat impressed.   
　But Hoshino's mother, Sumi, looked apologetic.
<!--more-->

"I'm sorry I couldn't bring out a better dish. Instead, I put all my skill into making it."   
"Oh, no!　It all looks delicious!　itadakimasu!"

　With that, I took one of the deep fried pork chops and threw it into my mouth.   
　It was freshly fried, so it was hot and the delicious juices were spreading in my mouth. The batter was crispy and perfect.

"It's so good, I can go on and on with this!"   
"I'm so glad to hear that. I'm so happy for you, Yui."

　When Sumi said that, Hoshino shivered.   
　What's wrong?

"She actually made the fried chicken. She doesn't usually cook much, but suddenly she said, 『 Mom, teach me how to cook! 』 I was surprised. She wanted Tanaka-san to eat it."   
"Wait, Mom!　I told you not to say that!"

　Hoshino said shyly, but Sumi was unaffected, saying, "Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed". Mothers are strong in every family.   
　I'm still a little embarrassed ...... that she would go to such lengths for me.

"Mogu Mogu Baku Baku"    
"Mother, this is delicious!"

　Ryota and Akari were also eating happily.   
　The family seems to be getting along well.

"Riri, want to eat"

　Riri was also speaking in familiar language and urging me to feed her.   
　I took a reasonably sized piece of fried chicken and brought it close to Riri, and her big mouth opened and she munched on it. The moment was a bit gruesome.

"Mmmm, mmm."

　Riri seemed to like it, too, and danced with delight, swaying her body from side to side.   
　She doesn't do this dance often, even when she eats churu.

　By the way, I posted a short video of this dance a few days ago, and it got over a billion views. It has become an internet meme, and various fan videos have been posted.   
　Riri's popularity is unbelievable.

"Mom, take that!"   
"Something like this happened in the dungeon the other day......"   
"Oh, my God, that happened."   
"Oh, I didn't do my homework."

　The Hoshino family was conversing peacefully.   
… Even so, if I'm the only one mixed in like this, it kind of makes me feel like I'm married. It's itchy, but ...... it's very comfortable.   
　This taste of home also reminds me of when I used to have dinner with my family.

"Can I help you?"

　Sumi asked me, wondering why my chopsticks had stopped.   
　I guess I made her worry.

"No, no. It's been a long time since we had dinner around the table like this, so I got a little sentimental. I'm sorry."   
"I see........ Excuse me, but how is your family doing, Mr. Tanaka?"

　I hesitated a little to answer Sumi's question.   
　This story is not very interesting to hear. That's why I don't talk about it much,......, but today I was a bit relaxed. I tell it in the hope that maybe they will accept it.

"I don't have any siblings. Both of my parents ...... are dead. They were hospitalized for magic element poisoning, and I managed to pay for their treatment and get out of the hospital, but they never regained the ...... strength they had lost."

　With the money I borrowed from Suda and the money I earned from working, I was able to pay for the hospitalization and treatment.   
　Thanks to my contacts in the government, I was able to get them the latest in magic element poisoning treatment.

　However ......  I was unable to save my parents.   
　 The two died a short time after I returned from the dungeon just below the Imperial Palace.   
　Looking back, I think the death of my parents was one of the reasons I threw myself into my work as if I was running away and became mentally ill.

"Was it so ......?"   
"Oh, I'm sorry!　I'm sorry for telling you such a heavy story. I'm over it now, so I'm fine. I'm an adult now, you know. I'm not going to keep dragging it on forever."

　When I tried to make it up to her, she looked troubled.   
　I'm in trouble. I talked too much.

　As I was reflecting on this, Hoshino suddenly stood up with a thud!　

"That's not okay at all!　You have to properly say you're sad when you're sad!"

　Tears were in Hoshino's eyes as she insisted.   
　It seems that she was too close to my feelings and became sad herself.

"I was sad too when my father passed away, it was so hard ...... and I cried a lot ...... ugh ......."

　As she spoke, Hoshino began to shed large, ragged tears and finally became unable to speak. Sumi, who was sitting beside her, began patting her back and saying, "Okay, okay."

"I'm sorry, Tanaka-san. She is worried about you. She recently watched a video of episodes from your days as a company employee. ......"   
"Oh, I see. ......"

　D-tube's main content is dungeon delivery, but you can also post regular videos.   
　There is a genre of so-called "commentary videos," in which an artificial voice explains something, which has been popular for a long time. (Tl: Can't escape the AI voiceover videos, even in a fantasy world)

　I guess Hoshino must have seen the video of me explaining my story.

"It's okay to be sad. Even if you say that, it might be difficult for Tanaka-san, who is an adult man. There will be more times when you have to be tougher. So, if your sadness has no place to go after this... please come to my house again. I can't do much, but I will cook you a warm meal again."   
"Sumi-san......"

　I felt saved by those words.   
　I am very grateful to have a place that welcomes me warmly.

"Thank you very much. If there is another opportunity, I will be at your service."   
"No, no, no. You are a great benefactor to my daughter. You are like family to me, so please don't worry about it." 

　Saying this, Sumi-san smiled at me in the same way I remember my mother smiling at me.
