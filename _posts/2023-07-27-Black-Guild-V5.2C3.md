Tl: Sam

…


"I've never seen a treasure chest before!　What's in it?"   
"Wait, you shouldn't open it carelessly, treasure chests are often a trap."   
"I'm sorry. That's right. ......"

　If you open it, poison may spew out, spikes may grow, the ceiling may fall down, or you may be transferred to the inside of a monster house. Traps set in treasure chests abound.   
　Many explorers have lost their lives by carelessly opening them.

「The traps are indeed scary. ......」   
「Even in the death rate of explorers, the percentage of traps is high.」   
「Especially with mimics, it's instant death. It's really scary.」   
「Mimics are those monsters that mimic treasure chests, right?　It's a lower level monster, but they sometimes appear in the upper levels too, so it's too scary.」   
「I saw a mimic in a video once and it looked too scary. If I were an explorer, I wouldn't open any treasure chests.」

"What are you going to do about it, Tanaka-san?　Is there any way to see through the traps?"   
There is, but I haven't mastered it. I heard that if you take the 『 Treasure Chest Detection Test 』 and 『 Mimic Detection Test 』, you can detect them.

　Those who have these certifications are valued as scouts.   
　Many people try to get these certificates because they can be included in dungeon exploration parties even if their combat skills are low. However, the certification test is apparently quite difficult and only a few people can pass it every year.

　There are also 『 Treasure Chest Unlocking Certification 』 and 『  Treasure Chest Contents Identification Certification  』.    
　But I have not taken any of them.

"Most treasure chests are locked to begin with. It takes a lot of effort to open them."   
"Hmmm. Then I have to give up on the treasure chests?"   
"No, that's not true. There is a better way."

　I said that and sat down in front of the treasure chest.

「...... I have a bad feeling about this.」   
「Treasure chest-kun!　Run!」   
「It's just another brainless solution anyway.」   
「I knew it... I'll get you some rice...」   
「Hey - He's going to do something.」

　I aimed at the middle of the treasure chest and struck with my hand. The top lid of the treasure chest shattered with a loud "mishap" sound.   
　If you can't open the lock, break it. If the trap is triggered, just endure it.
　I can withstand the poison that the treasure chest produces.

「I knew.」   
「I knew it.」   
「I knew you would do it. ......」   
「I didn't know treasure chests weren't indestructible objects. ......」   
「No, it's not what it looks like, it's supposed to be pretty hard.」   
「There will be a lot of newbies who will copy this and smash weapons. Don't get it wrong, you can't break it normally!」   
「Treasure chest-kun: "Nuwaaaaah!"」   
「Treasure chest kuuuuuun!」   
「It's so broken it reminds me of Scale-kun!」

　Now, I wonder what's inside.   
　I hope it's something interesting, but when I looked at the contents, sharp fangs and a large tongue popped out from inside the treasure chest.   
　And that's not all. Limb grew out of the treasure chest, and it cried.

『 Gigigigigigigi ！！』

　It is a mimic, a monster that mimics a treasure chest.   
　It is rare to find them in the upper levels. It is a rare monster that I have never seen before.

「Mimic ━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！」   
「It's really here!」   
「He's so mad because he smashed the lid lol.」   
「Of course I'd be mad if I was sleeping and he put a sword in my face, lol.」   
「He's so scary lol!」   
「I thought mimics were really strong.　Are you okay?」
「No, it's just that he's a bad guy. ......」   

　The mimic turned its fangs on me and attacked me with its lidded mouth wide open.
　Apparently it intended to eat me.

『 gawgawgawgawgawgawgawgaw ！！』  
"Shut up."

　I hit the lid one more time with my hand sword.   
Then the mimic screamed, 『 Ghegyo ！？』 and was was cut in half. Phew, now it's quiet.

「Mimic-kun!」   
「He left in the blink of an eye lol.」   
「It's a lower class strength at least. ......」   
「What's that, ...... he just did a hand sword?」   
「Scales: "I can vouch for that guy's hand swords."」   
「The party speaks.」   
「Mimic, you're all busted up.」
