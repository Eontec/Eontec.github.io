"I've never seen a treasure chest before!　What's in it?"   
"Wait, you shouldn't open it carelessly, treasure chests are often a trap."   
"I'm sorry. That's right. ......"

　If you open it, poison may spew out, spikes may grow, the ceiling may fall down, or you may be transferred to the inside of a monster house. Traps set in treasure chests abound.   
　Many explorers have lost their lives by carelessly opening them.
<!--more-->

「The traps are indeed scary. ......」   
「Even in the death rate of explorers, the percentage of traps is high.」   
「Especially with mimics, it's instant death. It's really scary.」   
「Mimics are those monsters that mimic treasure chests, right?　It's a lower level monster, but they sometimes appear in the upper levels too, so it's too scary.」   
「I saw a mimic in a video once and it looked too scary. If I were an explorer, I wouldn't open any treasure chests.」

"What are you going to do about it, Tanaka-san?　Is there any way to see through the traps?"   
There is, but I haven't mastered it. I heard that if you take the 『 Treasure Chest Detection Test 』 and 『 Mimic Detection Test 』, you can detect them.

　Those who have these certifications are valued as scouts.   
　Many people try to get these certificates because they can be included in dungeon exploration parties even if their combat skills are low. However, the certification test is apparently quite difficult and only a few people can pass it every year.

　There are also 『 Treasure Chest Unlocking Certification 』 and 『  Treasure Chest Contents Identification Certification  』.    
　But I have not taken any of them.

"Most treasure chests are locked to begin with. It takes a lot of effort to open them."   
"Hmmm. Then I have to give up on the treasure chests?"   
"No, that's not true. There is a better way."

　I said that and sat down in front of the treasure chest.

「...... I have a bad feeling about this.」   
「Treasure chest-kun!　Run!」   
「It's just another brainless solution anyway.」   
「I knew it... I'll get you some rice...」   
「Hey - He's going to do something.」

　I aimed at the middle of the treasure chest and struck with my hand. The top lid of the treasure chest shattered with a loud "mishap" sound.   
　If you can't open the lock, break it. If the trap is triggered, just endure it.
　I can withstand the poison that the treasure chest produces.

「I knew.」   
「I knew it.」   
「I knew you would do it. ......」   
「I didn't know treasure chests weren't indestructible objects. ......」   
「No, it's not what it looks like, it's supposed to be pretty hard.」   
「There will be a lot of newbies who will copy this and smash weapons. Don't get it wrong, you can't break it normally!」   
「Treasure chest-kun: "Nuwaaaaah!"」   
「Treasure chest kuuuuuun!」   
「It's so broken it reminds me of Scale-kun!」

　Now, I wonder what's inside.   
　I hope it's something interesting, but when I looked at the contents, sharp fangs and a large tongue popped out from inside the treasure chest.   
　And that's not all. Limb grew out of the treasure chest, and it cried.

『 Gigigigigigigi ！！』

　It is a mimic, a monster that mimics a treasure chest.   
　It is rare to find them in the upper levels. It is a rare monster that I have never seen before.

「Mimic ━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！」   
「It's really here!」   
「He's so mad because he smashed the lid lol.」   
「Of course I'd be mad if I was sleeping and he put a sword in my face, lol.」   
「He's so scary lol!」   
「I thought mimics were really strong.　Are you okay?」
「No, it's just that he's a bad guy. ......」   

　The mimic turned its fangs on me and attacked me with its lidded mouth wide open.
　Apparently it intended to eat me.

『 gawgawgawgawgawgawgawgaw ！！』  
"Shut up."

　I hit the lid one more time with my hand sword.   
Then the mimic screamed, 『 Ghegyo ！？』 and was was cut in half. Phew, now it's quiet.

「Mimic-kun!」   
「He left in the blink of an eye lol.」   
「It's a lower class strength at least. ......」   
「What's that, ...... he just did a hand sword?」   
「Scales: "I can vouch for that guy's hand swords."」   
「The party speaks.」   
「Mimic, you're all busted up.」

　When a mimic is defeated, glittering coins, gems, and other items jingle out from inside.   
　Mimics have the ability to break down the ores, gems, and human equipment they eat and turn them into treasure. I gratefully accept it.

"Wow!　That's a great treasure!　But I thought you couldn't redeem things in the dungeon for cash on your own.......?"   
"I guess so. But now that Adachi is working on it, it might be possible to do so. If so, I'll split it with Hoshino."   
"Are you sure?　I'm hardly active. ......"   
"It's fine, of course it's fine.　We're diving together.  you've got to earn money for your younger brothers' schooling, so feel free to take it."   
"Ugh, thank you. ......"

　With tears in her eyes, Hoshino agreed.   
　Hoshino's life seems to be getting a lot easier with the increase in subscribers, but there's nothing better than having lots of money. I want to help as much as I can.   

「That's a good story. ......」   
「Shachiken, you're doing a great job.」   
「I mean, how do you know about her brothers and sisters?」   
「There was an internet stalker the other day who said that the table pattern in the video of Riri-tan's eating scene matched the table pattern at Yui's house. ...... maybe?」   
「Oh, 'I understand now', huh?」   
「You mean you're family ......?」   
「They've had s*x!」   
「I hope they've already said hi to their mom.」   
「They're a couple now, aren't they?」   
「I thought she was behind in the heroine race, but she's really catching up.」

　In the comments, a lot of cold-hearted comments about Hoshino's relationship with me flowed.   
　I'd like to deny it, but since I've actually visited the ...... house and I've already said hello to Sumi-san, I can't rashly deny it. I have no choice but to ignore it naturally.

"Ja, ja, other nani nika zatte naika omite milka."

「You're speaking in katakana, just like I pictured.」   
「You seem to have a guilty conscience.」   
「Speak up, Shachiken!」   
「Tanaka!　You've got to call me at the wedding!」   
「Is this the place to celebrate today?」

　I fished around in the wreckage of the mimic, deciding to ignore them naturally.
　The Mimic's limbs were gone, but the box is still whole, albeit shattered. When I cleared away the shattered pieces of wood, the Mimic's large tongue emerged from it.

"Oh, the tongue is still there, And it's a big one."
"Is this useful for something, Mr. Tanaka?"
"Oh, Mimic's tongue tastes good when it's cooked."
"Oh, eat ......!?"

「[Sad news] Shachiken, he was eating Mimic.」   
「Oooooh!」   
「How can you eat something that gross? ......」   
「Even Yui is shocked.」   
「That's right, Shoggoth can eat it, too.」   
「They're crunchy!」   
「A child who doesn't like or dislike anything will grow up to be a big boy.」   
「No, there's a limit!」   
「Is he out of his mind?　I wonder if he's had a psychotic break! (English)」
「The theory is that he's lost his mind because he's been living as a corporate slave.」   
「Well, if he had to eat monsters because he was having trouble eating, it must be because of his company lifestyle.」   
「Oh, Suda, you son of a bitch!」   
「Oh, I ate Yui's tongue.  [this account has been suspended]」   
「You've been banned.」   
「Be careful, if you comment too much gross stuff, you'll get banned.」

　I said I was going to eat a mimic and got pulled over.   
　Well, it's really good, but I'm ...... shocked.

"Maybe we should have a viewer participation monster dinner sometime and let people know how good it tastes ......?"

「You're muttering something awful, lol」   
「No, I want to go, but I don't want to eat monster.」   
「I love delicacies, but I want to go.」   
「It's going to be a dinner party with a worldview like [Toriko's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toriko).」   
「I'd go if I could shake hands with Riri」   
「I'm scared there will be shoggoth food」   
「I'm afraid the slots are going to fill up fast.」   
「I want to go to the real event, but the level is too high from the first time.」   
「Huh, let me eat something normal ...... cry.」

　Hmmm, a few people want to come, but most people are still resistant. It's sad.

"You don't like it either, Hoshino?"   
"Ee, I don't hate that ...... and ............!　I'm looking forward to it!"   
"I see!　I'm so happy."   
"Ha-ha-ha-ha ......"(Tl: Blink twice if you need help)   

「Yui, you're sweating a lot lol.」   
「Yes, I know, I can't say no, can she?」   
「This is the weakness of being in love. ......」   
「I'm sure they'll adapt to each other soon.」   
「They're like a married couple, aren't they?」   
「I'm looking forward to the cooking episode.」   

　And so, with Mimic's materials packed in my business bag, I stepped into the middle level with Hoshino.
