…


"So that's how it is ......."

　I mutter as I learned of Hoshino's father's past.

"When the cenotaph was built, I visited here once with the explorers who were saved. I was the only one in my family who was resistant to the magical element, so my mother and the others couldn't come."

　I knew Hoshino's father was dead, but I didn't realize he was a colleague.   
　Well, but since Hoshino's mother, Jun Sumi, was not an Awakened person, is it likely that her father is an Awakened person? Children of awakened people are more likely to be awakened people.

"I wanted to come to report to my father today. Also..... I wanted to introduce you to Tanaka-san."   
"......That's an honor. Can I pray for his soul too?"   
"Yes, of course. I am sure father will be happy to hear that."

　I went to the cenotaph, put my hands together and prayed.   
　I am sure that your daughter is a strong and good girl like you, Tsuyoshi. So please don't worry.

「Oh, I see. ...... I didn't know that happened.」   
「Oh, yes, it was in the news a long time ago. That was a terrible incident.」   
「I didn't know there was such a thing.」   
「In the olden days, people were killed by monsters every day. I'm sure this one only got a little bit of coverage.」   
「It's much less common now, but that's thanks to the efforts of Minister Dojima, isn't it?」   
「The government has compiled a lot of information on the dungeon. It's now safe enough for us to stream in places like this.」   
「I'll join hands with you.」   
「Yui-chan, I've heard that you inherited your father's strength from him.」   
「She even introduced him to her father, and it's inappropriate, but it made me laugh a little.」   
「The encirclement of Shachiken is forming.」   
「There's no escaping now, is there?」   
「Every move is too solid.」

　After a few dozen seconds of holding hands like that, I looked up and approached Hoshino.

"Thank you for telling me. But was it right for you to say this in the delivery?"(Tl: THat's exactly what I was thinking)   
"Yes, I did. I wanted a lot of people to know about my father. I also wanted to introduce Tanaka-san."

　Hoshino smiled as she said this.   
　Her face looked a little sad, but she seemed to have gotten over her father's death.

　......Well, come to think of it, maybe.

"Hoshino, you're not good with minotaurs......?"   
"......Yes. The SS-ranked monster that appeared at that time was an abnormally grown individual ・・・・・・ of the Minotaur. The name given to it by the government was 『 Bamocraft of the Ship Horn. 』"   
"Bamocraft ...... was a named individual, right?"

　Individuals that are more dangerous than other individuals and so strong that they can no longer be called a separate species may be given names. Such monsters are called "Named Monsters."   
　Incidentally, a bounty is placed on named monsters, and the government pays a reward for defeating them. By the way, the money is tax-free.

"The government formed a team to defeat it, but Bamocraft had already fled deep into the dungeon at that time. By the side of my father's corpse, there was one of Bamokraft's horns and a lot of blood left behind. Apparently, he escaped deep into the dungeon after being hit pretty hard."   
"I see...so it judged that it would be dangerous to pursue ...... and blocked the way to the lower levels, that's wise."

　Although it may postpone the problem, it is too dangerous to chase SS-ranked monsters that escaped to the deeper levels. As long as there are so many other problems with the dungeon, it's probably inevitable.

　Still, it's amazing; how could a B-level explorer fend off an SS-rank?   
　It is rare for an awakened person to further awaken their power at the point of death. I am sure the same thing happened to Hoshino's father.   
　But even taking that into account, he is an amazing person to be able to inflict a deep wound on an SS-ranked monster by himself. If he had lived, he would have become a renowned explorer.

"I never saw that monster in person, but I have seen footage of the battle as it was being broadcast. The Bamocraft looked so terrifying and...... I regretted seeing it. Since then, just looking at a regular minotaur makes me shiver. It's pathetic......."

　Hoshino's body trembled just remembering it. I think she must have been really scared.   
　I held her trembling hand to calm her down.

"It's not true, Hoshino is a great girl. I'm sure your father would be proud of you."   
"Thank you, Tanaka-san ......."

　Hoshino then buried her face in my chest, her shoulders trembling.   
　Her shoulders were shaking, apparently from crying. So far, there was no adult to rely on, and that's understandable. If it's about the size of my chest, I'll lend you as much as you want.

「You're so kind, Shachiken.」   
「I want to cry on Tanaka's chest, too.」   
「Me too, me too.」   
「So you're saying you're not in a relationship now?」   
「You can't go this far and not get married, Tanaka!」   
「Tanaka's chest is empty」   
「There's no room because there's three of them in there.」   
「Don't forget about Riri-tan!」

"I'm sorry, ....... I got spoiled by you again."

　Hoshino, who had been crying on my chest for a while, then moved away.   
　She still had red around her eyes, but she looks refreshed. It seemed like she was okay.

"I'm going to go back and have dinner. I'm tired."

　A little further back, we found an open area. There were no monsters, so it was a good place to take a break.

"Yes, I'm hungry!　I'm hungry!"

　With Hoshino, who had regained all her energy, we headed back the way we had come.
