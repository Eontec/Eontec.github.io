Tl: Sam

…


"Haaaaah!"

　Hoshino ran with a yell.
　She was shouting to inspire herself, but in her head she was calm.

(He has more power and speed than me. I have to read my opponent's moves and anticipate them!)

　Hoshino looked into the eyes of Bamocraft firmly.
　Then, watching the movement of his gaze, she predicted his next move and avoided an axe attack.
<!--more-->

　This method of combat was something she had learned from Tanaka along the way.
　Hoshino was like a dry sponge, absorbing what she learned from Tanaka and using it as her own strength. The speed of her growth was so fast that Tanaka found it enjoyable to watch.

"---- there!"

　Hoshino shouted, slashing at the belly of a bamo craft as she passed by.
　She could not yet see the object's weak spot like Tanaka. However, by slashing at the cracks in the abdominal muscles, she was able to successfully cut through the gaps in the hard muscles of the bamocraft.

　Bamocraft, who did not expect to be wounded himself, let out a surprised 『 bwoo ...... 』 as he saw the blood flowing from his abdomen.

"It is hard after all. I have to slash harder ......."

　Hoshino, on the other hand, had a grim expression on her face.
　She realized that although she had won the current cut, she had only slashed one thin layer of skin and hadn't done much damage.
　To damage the Bamocraft, she would have to put more force into it. The hand that gripped the sword was filled with power.

Booooo!"

　Bamokraft then swung his axe quickly and compactly, trying to keep Hoshino away from him.
　The attack was less forceful than before, but it was fast and seamless. Hoshino was unable to get close due to the difference in range and reach.

"Hah, hah......."

　Hoshino breathed heavily as she evaded.
　It had only been a few minutes since the battle began, but she was quite drained of energy.

　 Her spirit was worn out and her physical strength was depleted even more than usual.

(Tanaka-san continued to fight on his own even in this condition. He is still amazing.......)

　While she was thinking about this, the Bamocraft increased its speed further and swung its axe down from above her head.
　Hoshino, who was a little late in her judgment for a moment, caught the blow with the sword she held above her head.

"Gu, gugu ......."

　Hoshino desperately caught the blow, but the enemy had more muscle strength and weight than she did.
　The weight of the attack from above gradually bent her knees, and her arms began to cramp.

『 Buh buh buh buh buh! 』

　The Bamocraft laughed as it watched Hoshino in agony.
　The sneer was directed not only at Hoshino, but also at her father.

(See, not only you, but I will kill you and all those who are in your line, and lay waste to them)
　Bamo Craft rejoiced in his heart.

　And that feeling was conveyed to ...... Hoshino.

"...... won't let it happen."
『 Bu? 』

　The axe, which should have been powered, was pushed back slightly.
　BamoCraft tilted his head in wonder. Then,

"Don't you dare laugh at my father!"

　With a roar, Hoshino flicks the axe as hard as she can, forcing Bamokraft back a few steps.
　The Bamocraft is surprised by the unexpected force.
　Hoshino's whole body violently erupted with magical elements, drawing out more power than usual.

"Haaaaah!"

　Hoshino put her rising power into her legs and kicked the bamocraft as hard as she can.
　Bamocraft defended against the attack with his arms, but the force was so great that his body fell back further.

『 Buo......! 』
"I won't forgive you... never ......!"
