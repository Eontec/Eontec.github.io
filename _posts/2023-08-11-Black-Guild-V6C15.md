Tl: Sam

…


　Hoshino suddenly exhibited a mysterious power.   
　Bamocraft was familiar with the phenomenon.

　There is a phenomenon known as "Re-Awakening".   
　It is a phenomenon that activates the magical element in the body so that it burns up and draws out more power than usual.   
　Although there is a time limit until the magical element is used up, during the period of "Re-awakening" a person is able to perform at more than twice his or her usual level.
<!--more-->

　However, there are few who can achieve this.   
　It is a rare phenomenon that occurs only when one's life is in danger or when one's emotions are violently shaken.

　Some people, once they have experienced it, grasp the sense and can use it at any time, but such people are even rarer.   
　However, Hoshino had already grasped the use of this power due to her superior sense of talent.   
　In addition, because she had eaten monsters, the amount of magic in her body was higher than usual, and she was in a state where she could fully demonstrate the power of her reawakening.

"I don't know how long this power will last...... so I'll make this quick!"

　Kicking off the ground, Hoshino rapidly approached the Bamocraft and launched a slash as if to fold it up.   
　Bamocraft responded with his axe.

『 Buo...... ！？』

　Bamo Craft was surprised at the strength of his arm, which was more than he had imagined.   
　The hateful person who once inflicted wounds on him. he too had shown surprising power just before his death, but Hoshino's power exceeded him.

"Haaaaah!"

　Picking up on the gap left by Bamocraft's bewilderment, Hoshino grabbed her opponent's arm with her left hand.   
　Then, with all her strength, she threw her opponent away. The bamocraft flew through the air and rolled on the ground. He was surprised that he was thrown by someone much smaller than himself, and with only one hand.

"Not even close!"

　Hoshino, seeing this as an opportunity, ran up to her foe and swung her sword at him.   
　Bamocraft received the blow with his axe, but he was gradually pushed back. This is not good. The face of Bamo Craft is filled with impatience.

『 Buu......! 』   
"I'll finish it!"

　Hoshino flicked his opponent's axe and thrust his sword forward as hard as he could.   
　The target was the left chest. Subhuman monsters, like humans, often have a heart there. No matter how SS-ranked a monster is, it will not survive if its heart is pierced.

(We'll get it all out here......!)

　With the momentum of burning all the magical elements in her body, Hoshino launched her final attack.   
　The sword thrust straight into the left breast of the Bamocraft, and the tip of the sword stabbed into the chest.

　However...... the tip was only stabbed and it did not go any further forward.   
　To her surprise, Bamocraft gripped Hoshino's blade with his left hand and stopped it.

"Wha......!"

　Hoshino was surprised and pushed the sword forward with all her might, but the sword did not move as if it were fixed in a vise.   
　Bamocraft smiled wickedly at the frantic Hoshino.

"I'm so close, and yet ......!"

　If I could just push forward a few more centimeters, I could win.   
　Hoshino desperately put strength into her arms, but instead of getting stronger, the amount of strength she could put into her arms was decreasing.   
　The words "time's up" crossed Hoshino's mind.

『 Buo! 』

　Bamocraft slapped Hoshino's body and blew her away.   
　The power was tremendous, and Hoshino's body bounced off the ground twice and rolled.

"Gah, ah ......."

　Hoshino's internal organs felt as if they had been overturned, and a dull pain shot through her body.   
　She tried to stand up, but her legs were not strong enough. Due to the rapid consumption of the magic element in her body due to the awakening, her physical strength has run out.      
　However, Hoshino was not yet in despair. She gritted her teeth, endured the pain, and managed to stand up, using her sword as a walking stick.      

"Not yet, not yet ......."

　Her legs cramped and her vision blurred.   
　The most important thing to remember is that you can't fight anymore.

『 Buoh, buoh buoh buoh! 』

　Seeing Hoshino in such a state, Bamocraft laughed aloud.   
　The laugh, which contained strong derision and contempt, was directed more at her father than at Hoshino.

"Wow, don't ...... laugh!"   
『 Bwwwoooooooooooo!』

　Fearless laughter echoed through the dungeon.   
　In the midst of it all, ...... Bamocraft and Hoshino, voices that were neither of theirs, could be heard.

"I had a bad feeling and came here, looks like I was right."   
"Heh......?"

　Hoshino turned around in surprise.   
　There, she saw her mentor and most respected explorer, Tanaka.

"It's all right now. Leave the rest to me."

　Tanaka turned his head to look at Bamocraft.   
　Unlike his usual calm expression, his face was grim.   
　Was he angry at the monster that had hurt his apprentice, or at himself for having allowed her to go alone?

"A minotaur with a horn... I see, this guy is a Bamocraft. Certainly, I've never seen a minotaur with such amazing magic essence"

　Tanaka walked by Hoshino's side and approached the Bamocraft as if he were taking a walk.   
　Hoshino, who saw her father in the back of Tanaka's figure, anticipated a terrible outcome and exclaimed,

"No, no, please run!　Please run away!"

　I don't want to lose any more of the people I love. With that single-mindedness, Hoshino screamed.

　Meanwhile, Bamocraft raised his axe at the incoming Tanaka.

"I don't know who he is, but I won't let him get in the way of my revenge. I'll kill every human being with one shot," he thought.

『 Bwwooooooooooo ！！』

　A huge axe swung down at great speed.   
　Tanaka, however, did not avoid it, but looked at it squarely.

"Don't worry, Hoshino ----."

　The axe swung straight down and hit the top of Tanaka's head and shattered into ...... pieces!   
　Of course, it was not Tanaka's head that was shattered, but the axe. Seeing the shattered and scattered pieces of metal, VamoCraft's expression hardened.

　Tanaka, on the other hand, calms Hoshino down by saying softly,

"I... I won't die. ・・・・"

　Declaring this, Tanaka kicked the bamocraft in the stomach.   
　The bamocraft was hit as if it had been hit by a huge cannon at zero distance, and it was blown away with great force, rolling on the ground.

　Hoshino's eyes lit up when she saw this scene.   
　Before she knew it, her legs had stopped shaking altogether.
