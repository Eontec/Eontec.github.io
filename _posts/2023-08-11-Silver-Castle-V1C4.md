　On the way to the village, I hear various things from Shea.


　This forest where I am now is called "Yuld Forest," located in the northern part of the Eurysia continent.

　To the north of the forest is the Nord Sea. If I had fallen into it, I would have died. I can't thank the Silver Castle enough for doing its best to fly us to the land.


　And as for the question of whether or not this is a game world...... the theory that this is not a game world is gaining strength.

　First, I lightly cut my own arm with my sword.

　There was a sharp pain and red blood flowed. In addition, I felt hungry, so I ate some berries and felt a sensation of being filled up. I can't reproduce such a feeling in the games of my time.


　In other words, this is a fantasy world similar to Seven Knights Online. I had wandered into it as a game character.

　It's impossible, but I have no choice but to believe so.

　Well, it's better than being thrown out in my real world body. In that body, the monsters would kill me and that would be the end of it.


"I see it!　That's the Jimari village!"


　Shea, who is riding on my shoulder, shouts.

　My avatar is over two meters tall, so she is looking at me from a very high angle.


"Oh, is that it?"


　The village that appears is a very deserted countryside village.

　The population of the village is probably around a hundred.

　

　The villagers worked on the farm and hid in the shadows when they saw me.

　Well, it is surprising to see a big man in armor suddenly appear, isn't it? I am lucky they did not attack me.


　When I enter the village from the front, I am greeted by three adults.

　In the middle is an old man with a beard. He is flanked by two men with axes in their hands.


　When I stop in front of them, the old man opens his mouth.


"I am Gafas, the village chief. How can I help you in this village, knight-dono?"


　The chief's tone is polite, but he seems wary.

　The men behind him are shaking as they hold their axes. I think I'm scaring them a lot.


"Uh... ....."

"Gafas-san!　I was saved by this man!"


　As I wonder how I should explain this, Shea jumps down from my shoulder and explains.

　The villagers are surprised to see her, perhaps unaware of her presence because of how she has blended in with my armor.


"Shea!　Why are you here?"

"Actually......"


　Shea tells Gafas-san, who is respectful, how she met me.

　The location of the castle, which is currently camouflaged by stealth, is something I asked her not to tell anyone.

　It would be risky for others to know its location. I would like to keep it as secret as possible until I have a clear idea of how to supply energy and can install a defense system.


　While I am thinking about this, Shea finishes explaining the general situation.

　At this point, the two villagers lower the axe in their hands. It is a good thing, because it is not a pleasant feeling to have hostility directed at you.


"...... excuse me,  Dyle-dono. Though I did not know it, I was rude to my benefactor."

"No, it's fine. It is natural that you would be afraid of me because of my appearance."

"Oh ......, how merciful of you. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity."


　With that, Gafas-san and the two villagers lower their heads.

　Phew, I'm glad we managed to do this. I would not have been able to have such perfect communication alone, thanks to Shea.


"You must be tired. Stay at my house today. We are not a rich village, so we can't offer you much hospitality. ......"

"Thank you very much. As long as you give me a place to sleep, I will be fine."


As I am talking with Gafas, Shea interrupts.


"Dyle-sama!　Why don't you stay at my house?"

"Shea, your house is too small for Dyle-dono, isn't it?"

"Muu!"


　Gafas-san admonished, but Shea is not satisfied.

　I didn't think shea would miss me this much.


"Shea, I'll be back later, so don't annoy the village chief so much"

"I understand."


I pat Shea on the head and console her, and then head to the house with Gafas-san.
