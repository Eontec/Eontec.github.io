Tl: Sam

…


　When I arrive at the house of  Gafas-san, the village chief, I take off my armor and get into a comfortable outfit.

　I don't have to take it off by hand, though. I just open the 《  console  》 and remove my equipment, and the armor disappears in an instant. This system seems to be the same as in the game.

　Incidentally, the 《 console 》 screen can also be seen by Shea and the village chief. Both of them said they had never seen such a screen before, so it seems that there are not many people who can use it in this world.
<!--more-->

　So it would be better not to open the 《  console  》 screen in public.


"Thank you for your hospitality."

"No, it's nothing. I am sorry that I can only prepare something like this."


　The dishes prepared by his wife were lined up in front of me.

　Soup with vegetables and bread. A dish that looked like grilled fish and boiled beans.


　It may not be the most lavish of meals, but I can tell he is trying to entertain me as best he can.


"You are a benefactor. It would be polite to offer you more hospitality, but ...... we don't have much food in stock because of the recent crop failure. I beg your indulgence."


　Gafas-san looks apologetic.

　Apparently, the food situation is serious. Looking back, many of the villagers were also very thin.


　And yet, they were nice enough to offer me, a complete stranger, what little food they had. When I think of their circumstances, I am tempted to refrain from eating, but to do so would be to disrespect their goodwill.

　Rather than refrain from eating, I should finish my meal and do something to help them later.

　I take a sip of the soup they've prepared for me and gulp it down.


"......Yeah, it's delicious. Thank you."

"I'm glad to hear that. I have also prepared a small amount of sake for you. Please drink it."

"Thank you."


　Neither the food nor the sake tasted very good.

　But I feel warm inside.


(......I wonder how long it has been since I had a meal like this.)

　When I was a member of the Silver Knights, I ate dinner in the game every day.

　It didn't fill my actual stomach, but chatting with everyone and eating dinner filled my heart with that feeling.

　It reminded me a little of that feeling.


"Dyle-dono?"


　Gafas-san looks at me with concern.

　It seems I had shed tears without realizing it. I hastily wipe them away and apologize.


"Did I do something wrong?"

"No, it's not like that. I was just reminiscing a little about the past."


　When I answer, Gafas-san did not ask me any more questions.

　I guess he's being considerate of my feelings. He is a mature man.


"By the way, Dyle-dono. I have heard from Shea that you are the king of a land far from here. What brought you to this land?　Of course, if you have a reason you cannot tell me, then you have not heard this question."


　Gafas-san asked with great care.

　Well, it is natural to be curious about that. It's not normal for the king of another country to come here with nothing on his person.

　He knows that I can use powerful magic, so it's no wonder he thinks I'm here to invade.


"...... Actually, my country was destroyed once. I'm traveling alone in search of a new land. Please rest assured that I am not here to cause strife."

"No, I have no such concerns, so please rest assured!"


　Gafas-san mends as if in a hurry.

　Was I a little too intrusive in my response?　Well, it would be better to have a heart-to-heart talk. I'd like to continue to be friends with this village.


"But I didn't realize there was such a situation. I'm sure you will have a hard time from now on, but please take your time in this empty village."

"Thank you."


　I thank him and go back to eating.


◇　◇　◇


　That night.

　I couldn't sleep for some reason, so I went outside.


"Maybe it's because I'm in this body now that I don't feel very sleepy."


　In the real world, I was always sluggish because of my inactivity.

　But now I am light. I have so much strength in my body that I can run all day long.


　I could try changing jobs, but that would be a waste of time.


　In Seven Knights Online, there is a facility where you can change your main job, and you can pay money to change your job.

　The only way to change your main job is to pay for an item at the facility. I have that item, but it's a waste to use it since I don't have the means to replenish it.

　By the way, you can change your "subjob" at will. This one has no effect on status, so I'm not going to change it now.


"I don't know. Well, I guess we'll just have to test it out a little bit at a time."


　When I first came to this world, I was in a panic, but now I am strangely calm.

　This is probably because of my high status, and I think it's affecting my mentality as well. If I were the usual me, I would still be in a panic.


"I guess I really am in the body of my game character ......."


　Hmmm.

　I guess a normal person would be depressed, but I don't really feel that way.

　I've been in the game longer than I've been in the "real world" to begin with.


　My immediate goal is to repair the castle. But what should I do after that?


　If I go back the way I came, I might be able to return to the world of Seven Knights Online.

　But what would be the point of going back?

　I have no friends in the game, and I have no regrets about the real world.

　If that is the case, I might be happier living in this world.

　I'm lucky enough to have made some good friends.


"Fua.... I'm finally getting sleepy."


　It seems that this body does have sleepiness.

　It would be convenient if I didn't have to sleep, but it would be sad to lose the pleasure of sleep. This might be a good thing.


　I returned to the village chief's house and slept comfortably, trying not to make a sound.
