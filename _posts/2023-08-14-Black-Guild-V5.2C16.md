『 Booooooooo...... 』

　The abnormally grown individual minotaur, Bamocraft let out a low snarl as it looked at me.

　His nose was breathing hard and drool was spilling out of his mouth.
　He seemed to be very angry because he was interrupted from his fun time.

　However, he seemed to have a sense of reason and didn't jump on me right away. I guess he was just wary of the fact that his axe was broken.
<!--more-->

「This is Bamocraft!　It's so scary!」
「Wow, you don't see SS-ranked monsters very often.」
「I'm so glad Yui-chan is safe .......」
「I mean, the axe is broken. His head is too hard.」
「I'm so glad you're okay, Yui-chan.」
「What did he eat to get that body?」
「Shoggoth.」
「He was a monster even before he ate Shoggoth.」
「He beat EX rank before, but this is the first time he's fighting SS rank, isn't it?　Which one is stronger?」
「There's no one better than the other in those two. There are different ways to identify them. Well, EX rank is almost always stronger than S rank.」
「Thank goodness for experts.」
「You know a lot. You're like a monster doctor.」

"What's wrong, you're not coming?"
『 Buuuuu ...... ooooh!！！』

　I guess he realized that he was being provoked, and the Bamocraft came at me with a roar.
　Bamocraft opened his big hands and tried to grab me. I caught it with my hands outstretched in the same way. The two of us grabbed each other's hands.

『 Bu, ooooooooooooo ！！』

　Bamokraft put his weight on both hands and put all his strength into them as if he was going to crush me.
　I receive it, and a crack appears at my feet. I see, he has great power. He is indeed an SS-ranked monster.

「Why is this guy on par with SS rank in arm strength?」
「No, he's not at all on par, since he's looking so cool.」
「His sword skills and his power are too dangerous」
「Bamocraft you're sweating lol」
「Power!」
「Yah!」
「This is just the beginning of Shachiken.」

　Putting a lot of strength into my hands, I brought my hands down in front of me.
　Then the Bamocraft's knees bent more and more, and eventually its head was lower than mine.

『 Bu, oh ......! 』

　BamoCraft put all his strength into it, but he couldn't push my hand back.
　I kicked him in the stomach and let go of his hand.

『 Uu, u……  』

　Bamocraft looked at me in disbelief.
　I guess he had never fought someone more powerful than himself before.    It's the loneliness of the strong. I understand that feeling.

"I'm sorry, but I don't intend to play. You're done here."

「Get him, Shachiken!」
「Whoa, whoa, whoa!」
「It's getting hot in here.」
「Knock him out!」
「This is a death sentence.」
「It’s done. I'm going to go eat.」

『 Buuuuu ...... oaaaaaahhh ！！』

　Bamocraft pulled out two large swords from his back and attacked.
　At first glance, the attack appeared to be a brute force attack, but it was a move that had been calculated by the opponent. He must have developed these moves through many, many deadly battles.

　But I am no slouch when it comes to combat experience. You are not the only one who was trained in hell.

　I jumped into the storm of slashes from the Bamocraft and grabbed the sword at my waist.
　Then, I cut through the gap in the storm of blades aimed at me and delivered the killing blow.

"Waga-ryu kenjutsu, Blink"

　The sword flashed and fresh blood danced in the air.
　In an instant, my slash cut deep into the body of the Bamocraft.

　For a while, Bamocraft was stunned, unable to understand what had happened, but when he saw his body stained with blood and realized what had been done to him, he muttered, 『 Bu, oh ...... 』 and collapsed to the ground.

「Woooooo!　He won!」
「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the strongest!」(I think I'm starting to remember some of these commenters)
「Another easy win」
「Who could beat you?」
「Your muscles are in great shape today!」
「Yo!　The muscle man!」
「You're Asura reincarnated!」
「You have a heavy machine on your shoulder!」
「It's starting to sound like a body-building routine」

　I sheathed my sword after safely defeating Bamocraft.
　An SS rank monster that can't fight much. I had some expectations......

"Disappointing."

　I slumped my shoulders.
　Sometimes I want to fight someone who's going to give me a hard time too.(TL: I'm having OPM flashbacks)

「You're kind of disappointed, lol.」
「If you struggle with SS rank, you won't be able to satisfy Tanaka.」
「If it's EX rank, I'll have a chance ......」
「It's basically impossible to find anything above EX Rank and SS Rank.」
「He'll just have to let Yui-chan satisfy him at night, heh heh heh.」(Tl: It's amazing how the author makes the comment section feel like that of a real streamer with all those occasional annoying)
「Officer, this is the guy.」
「I still can't see the bottom of Shachiken. I wonder how strong he would be if he really tried.」
「I wonder if he can crack the earth.」
「I'm afraid I can't deny it....... lol.」

　I was about to walk away when I saw that the Bamocraft had been disabled from combat.
　Then all of a sudden, the Bamocraft that I thought I had defeated suddenly got up.

『 Buuuuut, uuuuut ...... ！』
"I'm surprised you can still stand up."

　As expected of an SS-ranked monster.
　Its endurance is incomparable to that of ordinary monsters.

　However, he seemed to have lost his will to fight after the last blow, and I could see 『 fear 』 in his eyes when he sees me.

「You're so scared, lol.」
「He has never met anyone stronger than him before, so of course he'd be scared」
「Scary, scary, scary.」
「Why is a monster scared of him?」
「A. Because he's Shachiken.」

『 Buuuuuuut...... ooooooo！！』

　Bamocraft slowly distanced himself from me and ran off to the side.
　There was a path leading to the lower level in that direction. It appeared that he was planning to run away.

　Of course, I had no intention of letting that happen.
　I kicked the ground and tried to catch up with him, but I stopped halfway.
　Because someone more qualified than me was about to fulfill that role.

"I won't let you escape!　I will stop you right here!"

　Hoshino stood in front of the Bamocraft,  and readied her sword.

Tl Note: The author has slowed down updates of this novel to focus on her newer novel, that she posts multiple chapters of, every week. I'm removing all the passwords and making it free access. My exams are getting closer, thankfully, I was able to cover a lot of my scheme in most of my courses(That I defintiely didn't wait till the last minuite to start studying). So Updates on this novel will continue to be whenever the author releases, whilw doing the other novel in the interim.
