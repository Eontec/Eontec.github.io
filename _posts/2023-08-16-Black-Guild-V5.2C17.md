Tl: Sam


…


「Eeeh!　Yui-chan, you're in danger!」
「What are you doing?　Get out of there!」
「Shachiken, go help her!」
「Wait, it's really dangerous!」

　The viewers were typing their comments as they watched Hoshino standing in the way of the bamo craft.
　It was indeed quite a dangerous sight from the side. Even though he was wounded, the opponent was an SS-ranked monster. It was still too much for the young Hoshino to handle.
　But,
<!--more-->

"Well, just watch for a bit. I don't think you'll regret it."

　I said and watched from the sidelines, not touching her.
　Hoshino was trying to come out of her shell. Chances like this don't come along that way. I've learned from my mentor that it's the role of a mentor to watch over you through those times.

　Of course, I'm always ready to help. The rest is up to Hoshino.

『 Booooooooooooo ！！』

　Bamokraft bellowed to intimidate Hoshino.
　He was bluffing, but if there was an opening, he would try to escape. Hoshino seemed to be aware of this and took up a position to prevent him from passing through the path leading to the lower level.

"Father fought without running away even if the opponent was strong!　I'm not going to allow you to run away!　Fight ...... me!"(Tl: Strong words from the one that's literally waiting for their second author given power-up in the arc)
『 Buuuuuuut ...... ohh ！！』

　Perhaps deciding that escape was not an option, Bamocraft pulled a sword from his back and slashed at Hoshino.
　At that moment, magical essence erupted from Hoshino's body.(Tl: Hold Y/△ for awakening)

「Whoa!　What the hell!」
「She awakened!」
「You've become Super Hoshino Man?」
「Seriously, you're a Saiyan after all?」
「She's this strong?　She's SS-ranked?」
「Shachiken raised an extraordinary person.......」

　The way that Hoshino's magic essence is coming out of her ...... could it be 『Reawakening』?
　I was surprised. There are only a few people in the world, including me, who can use it freely(Tl: Of course he can use it). I didn't think it was possible for her to use it.

　I see, the only reason she survived against the Bamocraft was because of that power.

"Haaaaah!"

　Hoshino swung her sword with both hands and caught the sword of the bamocraft head on.
　The two swords collide with a lound clang. The two swords remained stalemated as they crossed.

「What?」
「Wow. They are evenly matched!」
「The opponent is SS rank!?」
「Yui-chan, you're this strong!?」
「Wow!」
「Not long ago you were having a hard time against Ogre, ...... how strong have you become?」
「Eagles raised eagles, don't they?」
「Shachiken's training ability is too high.......」

"Gugi, gugigi......"

　Hoshino made a gruff voice as she caught her opponent's sword.
　It was no wonder. There was barely any magical essene in her body. By the time I arrived, she had used up most of her magical essence in her awakeining.

　She managed to fight by gathering what little magic she had left and forcing herself to use it, but she won't be able to do that for long. If things continued as they were, the situation would become even worse.
　Thinking this, I raised my voice to tell Hoshino.

"Hoshino!　Don't be stingy with what you have, use it all!　Don't worry about what comes after!"
"Tanaka-san ......!　Yes!　understood!"

　Hoshino nodded her head as she looked at me and then burned all the magical essence in her body at once.
　The torrent of power that blew out strengthened her body to the limit. In the face of this power, the bamocraft was gradually pushed ...... and eventually its sword was repelled.

『 Bwwoo ！？』

　Bamocraft's face was filled with shock.
"I never thought I would be defeated by such a small being", He seemed to be saying.

　Well, Hoshino certainly doesn't look strong.
　But Hoshino is a warrior I admire. Her power is endorsed by me.

"This is the end!"

　Hoshino gripped the sword with both hands and swung down with all her might.
　The way she swung the sword, I recognized it.

"When did she......?"

　The technique was very similar to my 『 Strong Sword・ 10000 broken swords』(Tl: One of the techniques Tachibana taught him, Someone should check the old translation so I can correct this one)
　I had shown this technique to Hoshino once. Hoshino reproduced the technique almost perfectly. That's not a move that can be learned overnight. She must have been practicing on her own ever since then.

"Haaaaaaaaaaah!"

　Hoshino's sword easily ripped through the hard skin of the bamocraft and sliced deeply through its body at an angle.
The bamocraft tried to reach for Hoshino's body, but ...... its hand cut through the air and then hung down without effort.

『 Bu, o......!』

　The light goes out of his eyes, and this time, the Bamocraft loses its life and collapses.
　At the same time, Hoshino also almost falls forward. It seems that she has run out of magical energy.

　I immediately rushed to her side and took her body in my arms.

"I'm sure you did a great job. You are indeed my disciple."
"I did ...... Tanaka-san. I, I ...... did it."

　Hoshino muttered in a trembling voice.
　I continued patting her on the back, encouraging her, "You did great".
