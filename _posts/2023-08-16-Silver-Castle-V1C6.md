Tl: Sam

…


　It had been three days since we had stayed in the village of Jimali.

　Of course, I could not eat and drink for free. I spent my time hunting beasts in the forest and using magic to solve the problems of the villagers.


　While I was doing this ...... I was completely accepted by the villagers.
<!--more-->


"Dyle-sama!　Thank you for the other day!"

"I just picked some fresh vegetables!　If you don't mind, please take some!"


　As I was walking with Shea, I was approached by villagers.

　It's kind of itchy.


"As expected of Dyle-sama!　You're totally popular!"


　Shea said excitedly.


"It seems that the villagers finally understand how great you are!"

"I'm not that great, Shea."

"Kuu, such modesty is also wonderful!"

"...... That's very kind of you."


　Shea is still very fond of me.

　I thought the fever would cool down in a few days, but it looks like it's going to last a while.


"I'm home."

"Sorry to bother you."


　I entered her house with Shea.

　My head almost hit the door, but I bent down to avoid it.

　I'm not sure I'd fit in a normal person's house with my body like this. ｜The  buildings in the world of "Seven Knights Online" were made quite large.


"What a surprise! Welcome, Dyle-sama. Let me prepare some tea."


　When I entered the house, I was greeted by Anna, Shea's mother.

　Shea's father passed away a few years ago, and now she and Anna live together as mother and son.

　When she found out that I had saved her, she thanked me so much that I thought my head was going to hit the ground.


"Dyle-sama. What do you want to know today?"


　When we got to the table, Shea brought a lot of books from her room and put them in front of me.

　Shea had been teaching me a lot of things about this world lately.

　There are many things I needed to know about geography, history, climate, and so on. I can't read the script of this world, so having Shea as an interpreter was a big help to me.


"Even so, it's amazing that she can read at her age. Shea is going to be a great person."

"Thank you very much."


　She smiled happily as I said this to Anna-san, who put the tea down for me.

　It's not a joke, it's an established fact. Only a few people in this village can read. Even in a prosperous town, there are not that many people who can read.


　And yet Shea learned to read and write at such a young age. This must be a talent.


"I'm thinking of sending her to the royal academy in a little while. If she stays in this village, she won't be able to study much."

"That's wonderful. I am sure it will be a good experience."


　It is not my right to say this, since I had never been to school, but I think she should study.

　Otherwise, you would become a useless person like me.


"Dyle-sama, please don't just talk to your mother all the time!"

"Oh, I'm sorry. Well, ...... can I ask you to think with me today about how we can fix my castle?"


　I had learned quite a bit about this world, but I was still no closer to fixing the Silver Castle.

　The internal organs had almost stopped working and the outer walls were falling apart. I felt sorry for it if it stays like that, and I wanted to fix it as soon as possible.


"How can we fix the castle? I know there are many architects in the capital, but I don't think they can fix the castle."

"I see. That castle is different from ordinary castles."

"Yes, it is. Yes, and there is also the problem of materials. I read in a book that buildings with magical effects use a lot of rare metals such as mithril. We also have to think about how to procure them."


　......After all, Shea's brains outstrip those of the other villagers.

　If she joins me, she'll be an excellent staff officer.


"Rare metal, huh? Certainly, it wouldn't be a problem if there were more of it. Is there something like a mine near this village?"

"There is a small mine nearby, but it is not possible to mine fine ore there. If there is, it is here ....... There is a mountain range in the south of the country, and I think we can get it here."

"There is ......."


　Shea, with the map open, pointed to a mountain range.

　It is quite a distance, but if you use magic, it will not take long.


"I've heard that these mountains are inhabited by dwarves, dwarves who work with iron. If we can get them to join us, they will be a great help in fixing the castle."

"...... Excellent. It is an impeccable suggestion. I knew I was right to consult Shea."


　When I praised him like that, Shia's face turned red and shyly said "Ehehe, thank you".

　This kind of reaction is appropriate for her age.


"What do you want to do?　Should we head for the mountains right away?"

"No, let's wait until we have a more thorough plan. There is no point in rushing. Success depends on preparation."

"I see....... As expected of Dyle-sama!　You're so smart!"


　No matter what I do, I'll always be liked.

　I felt like I was playing a gal game where there were no wrong choices.


　As I was thinking this, the front door suddenly opened with a bang!　The door opened with a bang, and a villager entered.


"Dyle-san!　Could you please come in right now?"

"Hmm?"


　The villager looked quite flustered.

　I got up from my seat and approached him.


"What's the matter?"

"My wife has suddenly collapsed!　She's in a lot of pain and she's about to die......!"

"I understand. I'll be right there."


　I quieted his distraught voice, told Shea to wait for a moment, and headed for his house.
