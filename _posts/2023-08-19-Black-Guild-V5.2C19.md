Tl: Sam

…


"Um, uh, you know, ......, it's been a while."   
"Is that so?　I feel like we just met the other day. Just the two of us."

　When I talked to Amatsuki while I was flustered, I was cut down so quickly.

　I had met Amatsuki at a park at night the other day.   
　At that time, she told me how much she liked me and took my lips. Even now, when I think back to that time, I am so embarrassed that my face almost catches fire.   
　I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to express that now, though.   
<!--more-->

「Shachiken, your face is so red.」   
「What's going on?」   
「What's going on?」   
「They were meeting alone together?　That's just too hot!」   
「A young man and a young woman were alone in a park at night ...... and nothing could have happened.......」   
「These guys ****ed!」   
「I'm here now. What happened?」   
「Dungeon cleared.   
Amatsuki attacked.   
Now Carnage.」   
「I see, I get it. It's too hellish!」

　I didn't have time to look at the contents, but the comments seem to be very excited.   
　Damn. I guess they're all chilling anyway.(Tl: And chilling they were)

"And by the way, why is Amatsuki here?"   
"The balance of power in this dungeon has changed dramatically since you defeated the Named Monster, Bamocraft. The door leading to the lower level was broken, and it is easy to imagine that the monsters in this dungeon will become more active. There is a possibility of changes occurring that could endanger the outside world, and I am here to investigate."

　The work of the Monster Subjugation Bureau is not limited to defeating monsters, but also includes investigating dungeons and maintaining the balance of power in the dungeon.

　It's a tough job, to be honest. I can't speak for myself, but I think it's pretty hard work, and it's black.

"But why do you have to come all the way here?　If all you want to do is research, why don't you leave it to your subordinates?"      
"Well, yeah. I can leave this much to my subordinates. But this time I wanted to come.... Why do you think?"(Tl: Amatsuki bringing in all the heat)

　
　I'm not sure if you mean that you came to see me?　No, but Amatsuki is not the kind of person who mixes personal and business affairs. I'm not sure what to make of this thoughtful attitude ......, I don't know anything anymore.

　While I'm alone and confused, Tenzuki glanced at the drone floating next to me and then came up to me.

"You're filming, so you should at least be neat and tidy. You're sloppy."

　Saying this, Amatsuki straightened my loosened tie and adjusted my shabby collar.   
　I'm so embarrassed.

「They are already married, aren't they?」   
「Kanade-chan, you're coming on strong, aren't you?」   
「As expected of the first Strike Squad, they don't let their prey get away.」   
「What?」   
「I'm getting a little embarrassed watching this.」   
「Stop flirting.」   
「Riajuu, Explode!」   
「Maybe Tanaka won't die from an explosion.」   
「Yes, that's true lol.」   
「Well, then...... what would kill him?」   
「That's exactly what I'm talking about.」   
「Bamocraft-kun, please go to heaven.」(Tl: Took them long enough)

　Amatsuki brushes the last of the mud off my clothes and moves away from me.

"Oh, by the way, the director of the 'Magic Research Bureau' wanted to see you. Wants to ask you a lot of questions about the creature in your pocket."   
"By 'Director General,' do you mean...... Maki-san?"   
"Yes. You haven't seen the Director since that day, right?　Why don't you go show your face?"   
"Yeah, I'll try to go there."   

　The director of the Bureau of Magical Research, Maki Kurosu-san, is an old acquaintance of mine.   
　The last time I saw the director was the day I returned alive from the dungeon just below the Imperial Palace. It's been quite a while since I've seen Maki. Quite a strange person, but not the type I dislike.   

　Come to think of it, the last time I had dinner with Dojima-san, he told me that I should get Riri checked out properly. Maki-san is a dangerous person, so I'm a little worried about showing Riri to them, but I'm sure she'll be fine as long as I'm with her.   
　I'm also concerned about what Riri is like, and it would be better to have her examined properly.

"I'm going to go to the dungeon now, Let's go."

　Saying that, several people who seemed to be Amatsuki's subordinates entered the dungeon.   
　All of them walked in a steady manner. They must be very well trained.

　Amatsuki was about to head down with them, but then he stopped.   
　Then she turned her attention to Hoshino, who had been silent all this time.(Tl: Like a Tiger staring down its prey)

"Hoshino-san, was it ......?"   
"Uh, yes!"

　Hoshino was surprised to be spoken to all of a sudden.   
　I was also scared, wondering what she was going to say to me.

"I saw your fight in the video feed. I was honestly surprised that you could move that well at your age. Normally, you wouldn't be able to move while facing a foe of your own flesh and blood ....... You have a strong heart, just like your father."



....

Tl Note: The main herione comes again and affirms her postion. The one no one, neither Tanaka nor Hoshino could stand to.
