Tl: Sam


…



　The village's field improvement project went smoothly, and in a week's time, all the deserted fields were filled with abundant crops.

　The vegetables and fruits grown were all popular in Seven Knights Online. All of them are full of nutrients, and all the villagers who ate them became full of energy.


　......It's obvious that their muscle power and magic power have been increased from normal humans, but it's okay, right?
<!--more-->

　I'm a little worried because I've cultivated all these things that increase ability values.


　After solving the food situation in the village, I became revered by all the villagers.

　I now had more power than the village chief, and some were even calling for the name of the village to be changed to Dyle Village.

　I have no desire to be revered, but ...... well, I had reached a point where I could no longer back down. I'd have to live up to their expectations.


"I'm going to examine a lot of things today. Summon,《Call》, 《Angel Knight》"


　When the magic was invoked, a magic circle appeared in the air, and a knight in white armor descended from it.

　On his back were a pair of wings, and in his hands were a sword and a shield.


　This is a summoning magic that creates monsters that move automatically.

　It is a common magic in "Seven Knights Online,"  and was mainly used as a decoy.


　As an angelic race, I can summon angelic monsters.

　Angels are divided into nine classes, and angel knights 《Angel Knight》  are the lowest of the nine, the ninth rank of the "angels."


　Incidentally, my race was also changed from human to angelic, and my rank is the highest, the first-ranked  Seraphim. It took a lot of hard work to get to this level.


"Angel knight, turn around on the spot."


　When I gave that order, the angel knight silently spun around on the spot. It was a surreal sight.


"... In Seven Knights Online, I could only give rough orders such as attack, defense, and standby, but with this one, it seems like I can give detailed orders."


　Angel Knight is the lowest level angel. It's only around Level 30.

　However, according to my research, the normal villagers here are around 5 in level conversion. Even if they are bundled together, they are no match for the angel knight 《Angel Knight》. It can be said that it has sufficient strength.


　It's a valuable asset right now when we need a little manpower.


"Angel Knight. Will you plow the fields with this?"

"......"


　The angel knight silently accepted the hoe and began to plow the field.

　That's fine. I can leave the heavy lifting to you.

　However, he doesn't have the brains to think, so he needs someone to give him instructions. Well, I'll ask the villagers to do that for me.


"......Summoned monsters are supposed to disappear after a while, but I don't see any sign of that."


　I watched the angel knight working for a while, but he kept working silently and didn't seem to disappear. Is it possible that he can continue to move inexhaustibly?


　As I was thinking that, all of a sudden the Angel Knight stopped working and stopped right there.


"What's wrong?"


　I approached and checked.


"It doesn't look like he's dead. Maybe he's resting?"


　I tried using a restorative potion on the angel knight.

　Then, the angel knight started to move again and went back to work.


"I see. When the time comes, instead of disappearing, it will take a break. Is he recovering by sucking the magic power in the air?"


　I'm still uncertain about that part, but I've learned something good.

　It's nice not to have to summon them all over again. I'm glad I verified it.


Now, what kind of magic do you want me to do next ......?"

"Dyle-sama, may I have a moment?"


　Suddenly Shea arrives.

　She was in a great hurry. What is going on?


"What is it, Shea?"

"A villager was attacked by thieves and injured!　Please, please help us!

"What did you say?　Let's go right now."


　I stopped the experiment and went to the villagers.
