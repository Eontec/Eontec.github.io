Tl: Sam

…


"Ugh, it hurts ......."


　I rushed to the scene and found one villager there moaning in pain.

　There was a large cut on his abdomen. Was this the cause?


"I'll help you now. Recovery 《Heal》."


　A green light was absorbed into the wound, and in no time at all the wound was healed.
<!--more-->

　《Heal》 is a low-level recovery magic. The amount of recovery is not that high, but the average person's physical strength is not high to begin with. A single 《Heal》 can heal them from near-death.


　However, this is not a game, and even if physical strength is restored, energy cannot be as well. It would be impossible to move around immediately.


"It's all right now. If you keep resting, you will be able to move. What happened?"

"Well, actually, some Bandits showed up......."


　One of the villagers answered my question.


"Bandits?"

"Yes. There is a bandit who has been using this neighborhood as his base. Fortunately or unfortunately, they haven't shown up recently because of the continuous bad harvest, but they used to come here frequently and rob people of their food."

"......Such people existed?"

"Yeah. Where did they hear that our village was beginning to stockpile food? They will probably come back."


　The villagers looked gloomy.

　Just when the food shortage seemed to be resolved, the bandits came back. They must be depressed.


"Why didn't the government do something about it before?"


　Shea told us that the village of Zimari is within the territory of the Kingdom of Garmania.

　Naturally, taxes are paid, so the kingdom is obligated to maintain the security of this village.


"We have told the kingdom about this many times. However, the situation is not resolved by the fact that soldiers patrol the village once or twice a month."

"So you're telling me that the kingdom can't spare the effort for a small village. That's worrisome".


　The patrols are probably just random wandering around.

　 I guess countries everywhere are corrupt.


"I understand ....... I'll take care of the bandit."

"Ho, really?　Please, Dyle-sama!"

"Oh, you can leave it to me."


　As a member of the Silver Knights, I could not overlook the clear "evil" of banditry.

　The first thing I did was to go to the house of the village chief, Gafas.





"I see, the bandits......."


　Gafas-san sighed heavily when he heard about the bandits.

　I added a few words to Gafas-san, who was sitting across the table from me.


"It seems that the bandits took the food and fled to their hideout. They didn't bring back all of the food because they didn't have the manpower, but that means they know we still have food. They will definitely come back again."

"The bandits are persistent. The bandits are persistent, and Mr. Dile's guess will probably be correct. But still,......, I thought I could finally live a normal life,......!"


　 Gafas-san hit the table with frustration. He must have suffered a lot until now, and you could see the color of strong anger in his eyes.


"Gafas-san. I'm going to ask you to leave the matter of the bandits to me."

"I'm sure that Dyle-sama is a very skilled magician, but the other party is a group of bandits who will use any kind of cowardly means. There are a lot of them, and I think it would be dangerous......."

"Don't worry. The power I have shown you is only a fraction of what I can do, and I will not fall behind the bandits."
I understand ....... I trust you, Mr. Daile.


　The first time I saw him, I thought he was a good man.


"Thank you for your help. There are people who have lost their lives to their blades in the past. Please help us avenge their deaths."


　Gafas-san said, his voice trembling.

　It seems that the bandits have caused him a lot of pain.

　I grabbed Gafas-san by the shoulders and pulled him up.


"Please leave it to me. I will not let the 'evil' sit idle while my eyes are black."



◇　◇　◇



　I finished talking with Gafas and went outside to find Shea there.


"Dyle-sama. Are you going to fight the bandits?"

 "How did you know? Did someone tell you?"

"No, I believed that Dyle-sama would do it."


　Shea said with unclouded eyes.

　It's a little scary, because my credibility and likability are already maxed out.


"I'm not going to take you with me, It's too dangerous and too violent for children."

"I understand. I know I'll just get in the way. Instead, I'll give you this......."


　Shea handed me a map.

　It was a map of the area around this village. There are circle marks on it in several places.


"I've circled the places where I think bandits might be hiding. I think the most likely place is here."


　Saying this, Shea pointed to a spot on the map.

　No, no. Wait a minute.


"How do you know where they are lurking?"

"I've been asking around about the direction the bandits have been coming from and the villages they've attacked. After considering that information, the distribution map of the monsters, and the convenience of passage, we thought it would be most reasonable to hide there."

"...... Are you sure Shea is just a village girl?"


　There weren't any eleven-year-olds this smart in the world I was in, were there?


"I'm sorry. I can only help you to this extent ...... now. But one day I will grow up and be of more help to Master Daile!"

"No, Shea is already helping enough. Thank you."


　Then I combed Shea's hair like that.

　Then she smiled ticklishly. She looks her age if you only look at her face.


"That's right. While I'm away, you can use the soldiers I summoned. Summon 《Call》, 《Archangel Knight》."


　Five white-armored knights descend from the magic circle that appears in the air.

　On their backs were two wings. They look like angel knights, but their equipment is superior to that of the angel knights and they are taller.


"Dyle-sama. These people are ......!"

"They are my archangels, the 《Archangels》. They will protect our village."


　The archangels are one rank higher than the angels. They are sturdy and have high offensive power. Even if bandits came, they could easily destroy them.

 I also summoned about ten Angel Knights. Well, I think we'll be fine with this many.


"I'm going to be away, so you guys can protect this village."


　When I gave that order, the Angel Knights nodded silently.

　I wonder if it is really safe to trust them with this.

　It's certainly a fighting force, but it seems they're not good at thinking and fighting on their own. they would be easy to get caught in a diversion or something.


"I'll put Shea in charge of your command. Listen to what she says."

"What?　Me?"


　Shea is startled loudly.

　On the other hand, the Angel Knights kneel down before Shea. It seems that they will properly listen to what Shea says.


"Dyle-sama!　Did you really mean what you just said?"

Ah. They are strong, but they are not flexible. I want you to follow up on that."

"I am honored to be entrusted with such a big role, but can I do it?"


　Shea looked anxious.

　She has a brain that puts adults to shame, but she is only eleven years old. it is natural for her to be puzzled.

　But I think she's the right person for the job.


"Listen to me, Shea. You underestimate yourself, but you have a brilliant mind. I am convinced that Shea is the most capable of leading the Angel Knights in this village."

"I am ...... the best."


　Shea's eyes lit up.

　It seems that it touched her heart.


"Yes, you are the best. Am I wrong?"

"...... No, you're not wrong. I will prove to you that you are not wrong."


　Shea said strongly.

　There is no hesitation in her eyes. I think I can trust you with this.


"Good. Then I'll leave the village to you and I'll go immediately to the place you marked out."

"I understand. Leave the village to me."


　I left Shea and the Angel Knights behind and headed for the bandits.
