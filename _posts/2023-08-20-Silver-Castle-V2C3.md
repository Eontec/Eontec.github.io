Tl: Sam

…


　I was flying toward the mountainous area northeast of the village of Jimari.

　A dense forest spread out below me. It would be difficult to walk through this forest, thank goodness I have the magic of 《fly》.


"Ah, I believe that's the spot Shea pointed out......."


　The area that appeared before my eyes was a rugged mountainous region.
<!--more-->

　There are several caves there, it is said. Apparently, it is a perfect place to hide because it is rarely visited by people. It is also a good place to mess with other villages.


"Now, what should I do?"


　It would be easy to enter from the front and annihilate them all.

　However, I don't know if I could get rid of them all. They were bandits, unmistakably 『bad』 guys.


"If you are going to do it, then you must do it thoroughly ----"


　That is the policy of the Silver Knights.

　It was always the case when it came to destroying the infamous PK (Player Killer) guild.


"They used to say you couldn't tell who was the bad guy from the outside."


　We burned down their hideouts, flooded them, and confiscated all the items they had in storage.

　But I swear we only targeted bad players, and we did our best to return valuable items to their original owners. We did what we thought was righteous, even if it looked like wrongdoing to others.


"It's been a while since the guild war. Let's go out with a bang. ｜《Perfect Invincibility》"


　I casted a spell on my own body and made myself invisible.

　There are many types of camouflage magic, but this 《Perfect Invincibility》 is one of the best.

　First of all, it makes you completely invisible.

　The lower level magic  『｜Transparent Body 《Skeleton》』 cannot become completely transparent, and you can see distortions in the space. In addition, even skills such as "presence detection" can be easily detected.


　On the other hand, 《Perfect Invincibility》 has the disadvantage of not being able to make any attacks while using it, but it is not caught by most detection magic or skills.

　Well, the top guilds are very thorough in their countermeasures, but the middle guilds are often negligent in their countermeasures. I often used this magic to infiltrate and gather information.

"To be honest, I don't think it's necessary to use magic of this rank, but if you do something, do it thoroughly."


　I descended into the mountainous area in a state of invisibility.

　Then, looking at the map, I went to the point indicated by Shea.


"I knew it was true,　They've been storing a lot of food!"


　I heard a grating voice.

　I went in the direction of the voice and found about ten men dressed in dirty clothes, drinks in their hands, and making a lot of noise.


"Wow, It's just as Shea said."


　They had set up a table in front of the cave and were having a party. They must be storing their stolen goods in that cave.

　There were several horse-drawn wagons nearby. Were they moving around in those? I couldn't tell from the air, but it looks like the forest is lined with paths they use.


"Let's get some insurance before we start infiltrating ....... Summon 《Call》, 《Binder Authority》 "


　I summoned an angel about two meters long.

　Unlike the Angel Knight, it is not humanoid, and its body is composed of a geometric crystal and a number of white whips growing from it.

　Noh Angel is the sixth angel from the top, the sixth rank. Naturally, it possesses abilities that are a world apart from those of the Angel Knight, the ninth-ranked angel, which is the lowest.

　The Binder Authority angel that I summoned this time specializes in "binding" as its name suggests. Naturally, the whips that grow all over his body are not for beating, but for binding.


"When the bandits escape, catch them all. Don't kill them, okay?"

......


　The Binding Authority Angel responded to my words with a trembling body.

　I'm not sure if it really gets the message. I'm worried.

"I wonder if it's possible to summon a heavenly being that can communicate. I'll try again next time."


"Well, whatever. Anyway, I'm asking for your help"


　I reminded Binder Authority and headed for the bandits.
