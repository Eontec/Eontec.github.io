Tl: Sam

…


 "Amatsukii-san......"

　Hoshino muttered.   
　From the way Amatsuki spoke, it seems she was acquainted with Hoshino's father.   
　Well, that is also true. The First Division is always on the lookout for talented people. I'm sure they have all the information on excellent explorers. Maybe they've scouted him before.

　But it's unusual for Amatsuki to praise someone so much.
<!--more-->
　Hoshino's fight must have stuck in Amatsuki's mind that much. When she gets praised, it makes me, as a master, turn up my nose at her.

"Also, thank you for being friends with Rin. She doesn't have many friends, so I hope you'll continue to get along with her."   
"I'm the one who is indebted to Rin!　So it's all right!"

　Hoshino was a little flustered.   
　The mood is friendly. The last time the two met, the atmosphere was nasty, so I was worried, but this seems to be okay.

　That's what I thought......

"Ah, that's right. Rin-chan reminded me of something I had to do."

　Saying that, Hoshino came closer to me.   
　I was so close that our skin was almost touching, and I was taking my time to observe Hoshino's face, thinking about how long her eyelashes were.   
　Hoshino's face was slightly reddish and she looked a little nervous.

"What's wrong?"   
"My mother told me. I have to show it properly. That's why I'm going to be brave like Rin-chan."

　What are you talking about? The moment I was about to ask, Hoshino put her arm around my neck and pulled me towards her. And the next moment... Hoshino's lips were on mine.

"----!!!?!?"

　The suddenness of the situation confused me.   
　I was about to push Hoshino out of the way, but I almost stopped my hand from going out because it would have been dangerous.   
　As a result, I simply accepted Hoshino's kiss without saying a word.

「Holy shit━━━━!」   
「You did it, Yui-chan!」   
「Shachiken's hands are so fuzzy!」   
「Hold me!」   
「Chief Amatsuki is stunned.」   
「I'd be surprised if he suddenly kissed her in front of me...」   
「Well, the heroine race is heating up, isn't it?」   
「I haven't given up on the harem route yet!」   
「What?　Is there a route where everyone can be happy from here?」   
「The kiss was so long, Yui must have had a lot of time on her hands.」   
「I'm too jealous!　I want to do it with Shachiken too!」   
「Is it that way ......?」   
「This is normal!」

　This is the third time I've been kissed, but honestly I'm not used to it at all.   
　It's soft and smells so good ...... that my brain goes numb and I can't move. I can handle being poisoned by any monster, but I can't tolerate this one.

　Hoshino was doing so while hugging me, but eventually she slowly let go of my body. Hoshino seemed to be very nervous and even her ears were red.   
　She's so cute. I've been trying not to think of her as a woman, but if she does this to me, I can't do it anymore. I couldn't help but look at her that way.

"I'm like Amatsuki-san and Rin-chan. I'm not an old acquaintance like Amagatsu-san and Rin-chan, but I can't lose the ...... feeling that I love Tanaka-san!　So, um, ...... excuse me!"

　Hoshino said and ran away to the exit of the dungeon.   
I tried to chase after her, but my shoulder was grabbed from behind.

"...... Makoto, what is this?"   
"Hiii"

　Slowly looking back, there was the figure of Amatsuki, clad in a terrifying fighting spirit.   
　The gentle atmosphere that had existed earlier was no longer there.

"What are you doing hooking up with a young girl again?"   
"I'm sorry!　I'm sorry!"

　I didn't mean to do anything wrong, but I couldn't help but apologize.   
　I was so afraid that I was going to be lectured until morning, so I took advantage of the opportunity and ran away.

"Hey, Makoto, where are you going?"   
"I'm sorry!　See you next time!"

　I jumped out of the dungeon, snapping off the delivery.   
　Ahh... a lot happened today.

"I can't just run away fom them forever......"

　It would be disloyal to the girls to be slouching.   
　I went on my way home, wondering what to do.
