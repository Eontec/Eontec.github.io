Tl: Sam

"We have been waiting for you, Mr. Tanaka!　Please have a seat here!"

　Hazuki-san, seeing my face, smiled and guided me to a chair.   
　It was a private room, different from the general reception area where I had first spoken to her. The chairs were leather and comfortable, and the desk was made of good wood. Obviously, this is the kind of room one would use to talk to someone of great standing.

"Well...... can we get right into the formalities now?"   
"Yes, that's fine."
<!--more-->

　I answered Hazuki-san, who looked a little nervous.

　After finishing the talk with Mr. Kujoin, I was called by the building announcement and came here.   
　I'm not sure if the boss took care of me or not. On the desk, there were expensive-looking Japanese tea and tea sweets. I wasn't used to being treated so nicely like this, so it made me feel kind of mushy.  
　I've been asked to serve tea at the company guild, not to simply put it out.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, ....... It won't take long, just a few more minutes of your time."   
"Don't worry about it. I'm fine."

　Thanks to the conversation with Kujoin-san, I did not feel like I was kept waiting at all. In fact, I'm glad that I was able to talk to her because of the wait time.   
　Since I returned alive from the Imperial Palace dungeon, there are other people I haven't seen because I've been too busy. Now that I have more time, I might as well go see them properly.

"First of all, I would like to hand you an S-ranked explorer certificate. Please accept it."

　What Hazuki-san handed me was a shiny gold-colored certificate card.   
　The card had my name, explorer ID, rank, and a picture of my face on it. ......This mugshot is from my days as a company employee, so it's terrible. My eyes are dead. I should have had it redone.

"With your S-rank certificate, you can use almost all government transportation and public facilities for free. There are many other benefits as well, so please look here for more details."

　Hazuki-san said and handed me a thick book.   
　How many benefits are there? It's a hassle to read it. ......

　

"The next step is the reward for defeating the named monster, which will be transferred to your account as soon as you complete the simple procedure."   
"I understand."

　Hazuki-san put the documents and red ink on the desk.   
I took the documents and looked through them. I skimmed through it and found it to be a typical confirmation. There is nothing strange in particular.

　I thought I would just sign and seal the form and finish the procedure ......, but then my eyes fell on a particular section.

"What?"

　It was the section where the amount of the reward was written.   
　The amount written there was much larger than I had expected. Isn't that a strange number?　It's several times more than my annual salary when I was a corporate employee.......

"Um, isn't this amount too much ......?"   
"No, it's not!　Named monsters are quite dangerous individuals, and the Bamocraft is SS-ranked, so there are only a limited number of people who can defeat it. This price is fair."

　Hazuki-san leaned forward and stressed this point.

"And thanks to Tanaka-sama's defeat of Bamocraft, we can now explore the depths of the dungeon. There were not so many resources being collected in the depths of that dungeon, so I thought about the profit to be gained from it. Considering the profit to be made from it, I think this price is rather cheap!
"Is that so?"

　I was pushed a little by Hazuki-san's passionate speech.

　Even so, I never thought that named monster subjugation could make so much money.    
　I defeated a couple of them when I was a company employee. ......The guild was getting so much money?　It didn't look like the company guild had much money for that.

　Maybe ...... that Suda was pocketing it?　That guy would do it. He often went to expensive restaurants for dinners and such. Maybe he was going with a pretty lady, not a big shot.(Tl: Going on dates instead of business meetings)   
　Damn, if he got so much money, he should have at least given me a bonus. Now I'm starting to get angry.

Well, I'm going back and fixing the chapters.

You Can also submit in the comments of this chapter.
