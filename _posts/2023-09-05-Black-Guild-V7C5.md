Tl: Sam

…


"If the amount is correct, please sign your signature. Or is there something wrong with ......?"   
"No, no. No, no, this is fine. I'll sign it."

　I can't complain about this.   
　There was nothing against me in the document, so I had no problem with it.

　I signed in three places and stamped my seal. Then I noticed a piece of paper that looked like colored paper in the document.
<!--more-->

"Hm?　This is......."   
"Oh, um. If you don't mind, would you mind signing it personally ......?"

　When I looked at Hazuki-san's face, it was bright red.   
　She didn't look like the type of person who would mix public and private matters, but she wanted my autograph that badly?　Hmmm, I wonder.

　I didn't know if my autograph was worth it, but I had to respond to his request.

"Your autograph, yes, that's fine."   
"Really?　Thank you!"

　Hazuki-san was delighted with a big smile on his face.   
　If she's this happy with just an autograph, it's worth writing.

　I wrote the signature I had secretly practiced on the colored paper. Then Riri jumped out of my breast pocket and landed next to the paper.

"Riri!"   
"Hm?　What's wrong, Riri?"

　Riri began tugging at the pen I was holding.   
　Maybe Riri wants to write, too?　But Riri is too small to hold a pen, and as I was thinking about that...... my eyes fell on a red ink pad for seals.

"This would work for Riri, too."

　I grabbed Riri's hand and let her place her fingertip on the red ink.   
　Then I place Riri's reddened hand on the colored paper. Riri's handprint was left on the paper.

"I guess even Riri can sign this."   
"Riri!"(Tl: She sounds so proud of herself)

　Riri happily flicked her handprint to the edge of the paper.   
　I'm glad she's satisfied with it,......, I thought, but then I thought about it and realized that it might be a nuisance for Hazuki to have to deal with. I thought about it and suggested to her that I would write her signature on the other colored papers as well,

"Well, I never thought that even Riri would sign my autograph!　I am too happy!　I'm going to keep this color paper as a family heirloom!"

　Hazuki was sobbing with joy.   
　I was a little taken back by how happy she was. Riri also seemed to have no idea what was going on and tilted her head. You'd never think she'd be moved by her own handprints.

"Hey! I heard a loud voice, but what's wrong...? Why are you crying!?"

　It was a man in a suit who came in saying that.   
　He was about 50 years old. He looked like Hazuki-san's boss.

"I was so happy when I got this."   
"Oh, I see. You were a fan...... what are you doing getting autographs?　Get to work!"

　The boss was pushed by Hazuki at first, but then scolded her.
　Well, of course. That's how I would normally react.

　But she's crying right now, so I had to follow up.

"Well, I don't mind signing autographs, so please don't be so angry with her. If there is someone else who wants it, I'll write as many as you want."   
"No, that's not what I'm saying, but ...... no. Ummm ......."

　The boss suddenly thought about it.   
　I wonder what's wrong.(Tl: Lol big boss wants a copy)

"Well, um, I'm sorry, but could you please sign it for me too?　My grandchildren are big fans of yours, Tanaka-sama."

　Boss-san lowered his eyebrows and asked me to sign his autograph. I had no idea that he would actually ask me for an additional autograph.   
　I said, "Yes, yes". I was a little confused, but picked up an autograph pen. Then, as I was writing my signature to my boss, other staff members, who must have heard the rumor, started to come over to me.

"I've always had a crush on Shachiken......."   
"I love Shachiken!　I watch all your videos!"   
"I'm a member of his fan club!"   
"My child is a fan of Shachiken......."

　The stacks of colored papers were piling up in front of me. Apparently, when the staff members found out I was here, they bought some papers in the hope of getting my autograph.   
　Riri thought she was being told she could play with them, and she was flipping through the bills before I could.

　I had no choice. ...... Riri was keen on the idea, and we were on time, so I decided to go along with her.

"I understand. But I would appreciate it if you could give me one for each person."   
""""""""""Thank you! """"""""""

　A number of heads were neatly lowered.   
　In the end, I signed for almost all of the staff together with Riri.
