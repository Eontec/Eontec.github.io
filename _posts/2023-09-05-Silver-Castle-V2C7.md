Tl: Sam


...



　There was a group of people silently advancing through the forest.

　They were clad in light and durable leather armor, and had handy daggers at their waists.

　They were dressed in dirty clothes and had stubble on their mouths.

　They do not look like ordinary people to anyone.


　They were bandits who had this forest area as their territory.

　They make their living by raiding villages and wagons and stealing money and food.
<!--more-->


　If they continued to do so, they would naturally attract the attention of the kingdom, but they continued to evade danger by getting around. Sometimes they even resorted to bribing the kingdom's soldiers.


　Just when they thought they could continue to lead a smooth sailing life as thieves,----, something unexpected happened.

　It was a bad harvest.

　Crops in neighboring villages were severely damaged and there was nothing left to steal.

　There was a way to forcibly take all the stockpiles. But if they did, the village would be destroyed and they would not be able to steal anything more. This would be a blow to the bandits.


　Just then, they heard a rumor that a village had succeeded in mass-producing food.

　It seems that a mysterious traveler who found the village had somehow revived the fields. In addition, rain fell around the village at just the right time, and the food situation was completely solved.


　Suspicious, they snuck into the village and found that there was indeed a large amount of produce stored there.

　The quality was top class. With this, they would not only have enough to eat, but also enough to sell. The bandits were very happy.


　However, once the thieves entered the place, they would be cautious, and they would not be able to steal again until the situation had cooled down. Therefore, the thieves decided to invade the village of Jimali again without delay.

　They also wanted to find out more about the mysterious traveler. If he was so capable, they thought it would be a good idea to pull him out.


"Now, we are almost at the village. Do you have the plan in mind?"


　Their leader, who was leading the bandits, asked his subordinate.


"Yes. First, we will take control of the warehouse and detain one of the villagers. If there is no traveler, we take their food and retreat immediately, right?"

"Yes, no problem."


　Their movements were well organized for a band of thieves.

　They were originally soldiers of the kingdom.

　But when the war was over and they were sent home with little reward, they lost their jobs.

　They had no place to stay in their hometown and no place to work.

　In desperation, it did not take long for them to turn themselves into bandits.


"The country preyed on us first. Now it's our turn to prey on them.......!"


　The bandits set out for the village with a warped sense of justice.

　Then..,


"Gah!"


　Suddenly, one of the bandits let out a loud cry.

　When they hurriedly turned around, they found their comrade had fallen limp.


"What's wrong?"


　The fallen comrade had a large hole in his chest from which blood was pouring down.

　It was obvious to everyone that he had been attacked.


"What the hell!　The hole is too big for a bow or gun ....... No way, it's magic!"


　There was no sign of any arrows or bullets left, so it was reasonable to assume that the attack had been done by magic.

　The words "mysterious traveler" came to the mind of the leader of the bandits.


"Don't tell me it's that guy. ......?　Hey, you guys!　Watch the perimeter!"

"Yes, sir!"


　The eight bandits stood with their backs to each other and readied their weapons.

　However, they were ordinary people who couldn't even use magic, and naturally, they didn't have the skills to fight against a wizard.

　An unpleasant sense of tension filled the air, and cold sweat trickled down the bandits' cheeks.

　After a time that feels like an eternity, they heard a sound that was like a thud, thud, thud.


"What is this...... footsteps?"


　The sound was like a large beast walking towards them.

　Normally, they would keep their distance from the sound, but they were now being targeted by a mysterious wizard. There was no way they could move.

　As they stood there, unable to do anything, a knight wearing white full body armor 《Full Plate Mail》 appeared.

　At 220 centimeters tall, the knight was large, and the armor and weapons he was wearing appeared to be of the first class. On his back are wings that looked real, and they sometimes moved as if they were alive.

　The figure came slowly in front of the bandits and then stopped.


"W-what are you?” 

"......."


　The white porcelain knight did not answer, but stared at the bandits.

　The knight's helmet didn't have any holes to secure his line of sight. 


"What----."


　Before the bandits could finish, the knight's arm swung. The body of the man who had been speaking was cut in two and rolled on the ground as a mute corpse.

　The knight held a large two-handed sword in his hand.

　Despite the thick blade and the seemingly considerable weight of the sword, the knight swung it lightly with one hand.

　Clearly, this was not the work of a human being. To the eyes of the thieves, the knight looked not like a man, but like a hideous monster. (Tl: To be fair, It is more or less a monster)



"N-run away!!"


　The bandits ran away as if scattering spiders when the mysterious creature attacked them.

　The next moment, several flashes of light flashed through the forest.

　They are arrows of light. They accurately shot through the bandits' bodies and killed them one after another.


"What the hell is going on?"


　The leader of the bandits ran away screaming.

　Everything should have been going so well. As he desperately ran away, he wondered what had gone wrong.


"We were abandoned by our country, so we should be allowed to do whatever we want!　And yet!"

"No, that's not true. It is not you who decides, but ...... that One."


　As if interrupting the bandit's voice, a high, beautiful voice was heard.

　The next moment, a knight, smaller in stature than the previous one, descended from the sky and landed on the ground, creating a noise and a cloud of dust. He intercepts the bandit's path.

　On the knight's shoulder was a girl, who was looking at the bandit with cold eyes.(Tl: Now THAT is an entrance)


"The 《Angel knight》 is deployed along your escape route. Escape is impossible."


　Shea, the girl, said coldly.

　She was entrusted by Dyle with the defense of the village, and she immediately took action.


　She predicted the route that the bandits would use, taking into account the past invasion routes and the terrain around the village. She deployed an angel knight to stand guard.

　As soon as they knew they were approaching, they gathered other Angel Knights and began attacking the bandits.


　Methods for securing all the routes of entry had already been established and shared with the Angel Knights. No matter how short of a supply, they could handle it. Shea was confident.


"There is no escape now. Please give up."

"Shut up!　It's not our fault, it's the country's fault!"

"I'm sorry....... 《Angel knight》, please."


　The 《Angel Knight》 shot out an arrow of light from his hand.



....


Tl Note: I just want to say that that even Dyle can't properly control these Angel Summons, yet here she is, riding one in an epic villain entrance. I love it.
