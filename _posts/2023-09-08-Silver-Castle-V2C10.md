Tl: Sam

…


　----Time goes back a bit.


　That day I was thinking about something.

　It was about the concept of 『level』 in this world.


　The magic 《Level Seeing》, which allows you to check the level of your opponent. When I used this on people in this world, it would normally activate and I could check their level.
<!--more-->

　The average level of a child was about level 1 or 2, and the average level of an adult was about 4 to 7.


　It is imaginable that these levels would naturally increase as they grow up.

　Then, will the level go up by defeating monsters like in "Seven Knights Online"?


　If so, it will be easier to make strong friends. I really wanted to research that.


"Aa!　My Lord!　I am honored to meet you!"


　As I was walking through the village, I was suddenly approached by a man.

　I looked and there was a young man with blond hair.

　His name is Marcus. He is the priest whom I saved from slavery the other day.

　I told him to go back to his hometown, but he was a strange priest who did not stay in one city but traveled around and proselytized.


　This priest, who was convinced that I was a god, said he would stay in the village of Jimari.

　Whenever he meets me, he prays with a noisy intensity. To be honest, it annoys me, but I can't afford to be too harsh with him, so I put up with it.


"My Lord Dyle-sama. You seemed to be troubled by something, ...... what is it?"

"......you're surprisingly perceptive."


　Marcus has a nice face and is very attentive. He is the type that seems to be popular with women.

　Hmm, this guy always seems to have some free time, so it might be a good idea to ask him to join me in my experiments. This guy's conscience won't hurt even if he does some wild experiments. 


"Marcus, do you have time for a little help?"

"Of course, my Lord!　I, Marcus, am willing to go through any ordeal!


　Marcus replied with an exaggerated gesture.

　I've got your word. I'll let you go along with me as long as you like.


"All right, then, let's head for the woods. Follow me."

"As you wish!"


　And so I set out with my noisy collaborator.



◇　◇　◇


　I came with Marcus to the forest of Ylde.

　It was the first place I visited when I came to this world, and the place where I met Shea.


　It's a big place and not many people come here, so it's a good place to do some experiments.


"I was wondering if you had any idea what you were doing when you heard the word "level"? Does the word 'level' mean anything to you?"

"Level ......?　I'm sorry, this Marcus doesn't sound familiar.......　

Oh, I hate my poor, inadequate head!　Please punish me!"

"No, if you don't know, that's okay, I won't bother punishing you for it."

"Aah!　How generous of you!"


　Don't get offended by all this noise.

　Let's get on with the story.


"Have you ever heard of people getting stronger by defeating monsters?"

"Yes, it is our common knowledge that those who fight monsters generally get stronger faster. It is said that the life force of the monster flows into the person who defeats the monster."

"I see."


　Is that how experience is treated in this world?

　In that case, it seems like you can become stronger using the same method as in Seven Knights Online.


Marcus. I'm going to experimentally make you stronger now. Is that alright with you?

"Of course, my Lord. Since the day I became a priest, I have dedicated myself to God."


　I think I'm a different God than the one he believes in, but ...... that's okay.

　I quickly offered Marcus a certain ring to experiment with.


"Please put this on first."

"As you wish."


　Marcus put on the ring without any hesitation.

　He put on the item called 《Party Ring》. The person who puts it on is forced to join the same party as the person who made the ring. Of course, the party will be dissolved if the distance is too great.

　Those in the same party share experience.

　In other words, if the effect of this ring is active, when I kill a monster, Marcus also receives experience.


　Incidentally, in Seven Knights Online, you could easily form a party by using the party function on the console or by becoming a member of the same guild.

　However, in this world, there is no "Party" item on the 《Console》 control panel. And since I didn't want Marcus to join the guild, the only way left was to use the 《Party Ring》.


"Appraisal 《Level Seeing》"


　Marcus' level was currently 7. He was one of the strongest among humans.

　Having memorized this, I next took out a certain item.

　The item was in the shape of a small ball, and its name was "Capture Ball," which is a pretty close call. (Tl: To getting a copyright claim from a cerain company)

　When I activate it, a monster pops out from inside.


『Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!』


　The one that jumped out was the bull-shaped monster 『Giant Bull』. It's a level 10 monster that appears in Seven Knights Online. 

　When I had tried to breed it in the game before, I had caught it and sealed it in an item. But I had forgotten about it and had put it in the back of my item box.

　It's not a rare monster, so I can use it for experiments.


"What?　A monster suddenly appeared!"

"Stay back, Marcus."


　I let the flustered Marcus back up, and I activated my magic.


"《Slash!》"


　With a snap of my fingers, the magical blade sparkled and sliced through the Giant Bull's body.


　The level 10 Giant Bull couldn't withstand it, and it collapsed to the ground.

　I hadn't tried it before, but I guess the creatures from "Seven Knights Online" also become corpses when they die. In the game, dead monsters immediately turned into drop items.

　In this world, if you want materials, you have to dismantle them properly. I'm used to Seven Knights Online, so it's a bit of a hassle for me.


"Bi, I'm surprised ...... what was that ......?"

"The current monster is the one I summoned. Besides, Marcus, have you noticed any changes in your body?"

"Changes?"


　Marcus looked at his own body with a puzzled look on his face.

　Did I fail?


"I'm sorry, I don't feel any change in my body,"

"Hmmm. The most important thing to remember is that the information is not the same as the original information. Appraisal 《Level Seeing》."


　I checked Marcus' level again.

　His level was 8. His level had increased by one since before he defeated Giant Bull.


"I wonder if I would feel any change if his level had gone up by just one. Would he be able to feel the change if his level were to increase by 10 or so at once?"


　It is necessary to verify this.

　However, it was necessary to carefully choose the person with whom to verify this. The person who verifies it might betray me.

　If he got to level 100, there is a possibility that he could kill me. I have a revive item, but I don't know if it will work in this world.

　I could try to test it on someone over here, but even if it works on someone over here, whether it will work on me as well is another story.


　If I die, it's the end.

　I think it's better to act with that in mind.


"Thank you, Marcus. Now that today's experiment is over, can I have my ring back?"

"......Yes, sir. Please feel free to contact me anytime."


　He seemed to be wondering what kind of experiment I was doing, but after returning the ring to me, Marcus left without asking me any questions.

　It's not that I think he's going to betray me, but if I give him knowledge, there's a chance that he'll do something terrible later on. Whether it is power or knowledge, you should choose who you give it to carefully.


"Now, who should I try it on? ......"


　I returned to the village, pondering.
