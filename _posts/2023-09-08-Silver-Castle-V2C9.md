Tl: Sam

…


　After defeating the bandits in the cave and saving the people who were being held captive, I returned to the Jimari village.

　I could have returned home immediately by riding the angel I summoned, but the captives, especially the priest, refused, saying, " That's absurd!" I had to walk home.


　Angels are just monsters that I can summon as many as I want, but to the people here, they are sacred beings.

　I should not treat them too carelessly.


"Welcome back, Dyle-sama!"

　Shea was the first to rush up to me.

　The bandits must have come to the village, but they didn't look particularly tired. I wonder if there weren't enough of them.


"I'm home, Shea. It looks like you protected the village, great job."

"Heh heh."


　When I patted her head, Shea's face relaxed.

　When I see things like this, I feel like a child. I have to be careful not to do anything too shocking. If she sees blood or something, she'll probably get hurt.(Tl: She's actually the devil)


"Well, you know. I have captured the most important of the bandits who came to the village."

"What?　You did that?"

"Yes, Yes. He is tied up in that warehouse."


　I didn't think she had done her job that perfectly.

　I guess it was the right decision to leave it to 《Angel Knight》.


"Hmm... However, I've already heard everything I wanted to ask from the other thieves, so I don't think there's anything I want to ask now. I'm sorry you went to the trouble of catching him."

"No, don't be sorry!　I did it on my own!　...... Well, what do you want me to do then?　Shall I get rid of it?" 

"I can't leave such a dirty thing to Shea. I will give the order from my side."


　I'm going to give an order to the angel knight who is standing by and have him dispose of the bandit.

　Incidentally, the bandits I brainwashed with Conversion had already been disposed of. There is no mercy for the wicked.


"That's right. I brought the captured people and the stolen goods from the bandit's hideout. I'm sorry, but may I ask you to take care of these?"

"Yes, sir!　Of course!　I'm very good at that kind of detail!"


　Shea replied happily.

　The first time I asked her for a favor, I was a little hesitant to do so, but recently I feel that I have lost my hesitation. 


"You can use the summoned Angel Knights as you like. Please help me."

"Yup!　Leave it to me!"


　Shea was full of enthusiasm.

　I'd have to do my best to keep up with her work.



◇　◇　◇ 



　One week after the bandit trouble.

　Thanks to the efforts of Shea and the other villagers, almost all of those who had been captured were able to return to their former villages.

　The few who hadn't returned are still in the Jimari village. They don't want to leave me. I felt sorry for them, so I built them a new house in the village. By the way, the priest was among them, and he worshiped me every time he saw me.


　I am returning stolen goods little by little to their original owners.

　If you go to a village once, you can ask an angel you summoned to take your belongings and it's not that hard. Recently, it seems that what I have done has begun to spread to neighboring villages, and there are people who come all the way to the village of Jimari to see me.


　I don't want to be too conspicuous, but Shea is doing a good job of keeping me out of trouble. It's like she's my secretary.


　Oh, and one more thing has changed.

　Shea, who had not been talking to many other people her age, has made a friend.


　She made a friend, Luna, a beastman. She was one of the people I rescued from the cave.

　She was living with other beastmen in the forest near the village of Jimari. She often came to the village and talked happily with Shea about something.

　It's good to have friends. I hope that she will nurture her friendship and make many good memories for me.


　Well, things were hectic but peaceful these days.

　Just as I was thinking that it was time to start doing something to fix the castle, Luna, who was visiting the village, asked me for a favor.


"Dyle-sama. Actually, there is something I need your help with......."


　Luna began using an unfamiliar honorific.

　Her face was dark. Is it something serious?


"What's going on?"

"Orcs have been appearing near my village recently. But my people are no match for them, and if we don't do something about it, we will be killed one day......."


　The orcs are pig-headed subhumans, as I recall. they also appeared in Seven Knights Online.

　Although it moved slowly, it was a troublesome monster with high strength and stamina.

　It didn't drop very good items, and it wasn't a monster I would actively hunt.


　However, if they came close to where you live, there is no way to avoid them. This was a serious problem.

　I asked Shea, who was standing nearby.


"Shea, how many days do you think you can stay away from the village?"

"About three days is no problem. I can accompany you for that period of time!"


　Shea replied in no time. She is a very capable girl, as always.


"I see, it's perfect if Shea can come too. I have some things I want to try, so let's go to the village of Luna."

"...... eh!　Dyle-sama is coming?"

"I'm sure he will. It's only natural to help out a friend in need."


　I patted Luna's fluffy head.

　Luna's tail wagged in delight. She was shy and didn't show it in words or facial expressions, but she was still a child when she showed it in this kind of situation.

　.....I feel like Shea was looking at me in a scary way, but I thought it was just my imagination.


"By the way, Dyle-sama, what is it that you want to try?"


　I stopped stroking her and she asked me curiously.

　I hadn't told her about this yet, come to think of it.


"Even with the angels I summon, there is still a lack of strength. That's what I think."

"I see. ....... I do not think there is any problem with the current situation, but if Dyle-sama says so, then there must be no doubt about it."


　Certainly, as Shea said, if you look at it from a general perspective, the strength of this village is not a problem.

　Since we summon various kinds of angels every day, we usually see them in the village. Even if we fought a big country, we have the strength here that we would not be defeated so easily.


　But what if a player came from Seven Knights Online?

　I doubt if I and my summoned angels would be enough to win. Even if we could win, I don't have confidence in my ability to protect people over here like Shea and Luna.


"I thought about it. How can I protect the people of this village? And I came to a conclusion."


　Shea and Luna gulped when they heard these words.

　Both of them are curious. After I had made a big show of it, I said those words.

 
"It's time for leveling."
