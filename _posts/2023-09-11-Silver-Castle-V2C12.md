Tl: Sam

…


"I'm sorry to bother you."

"Welcome."


　When I entered the house, I was greeted by a beastman.

　Like Luna, he had white hair. He was about sixty years old. He looked quite old.


"My name is Tungul. Please have a seat here."


　I sat down on the cushion placed in front of him as Mr. Tungul urged me.

　The beastmen in Seven Knights Online were a bit rough around the edges, but this man was quite calm and rational. It is dangerous to make assumptions based on in-game impressions.

"First of all, let me thank you. Thank you for saving Luna."


　Tungul-san bowed deeply.

　When I sent people back to their villages, I often sent them back with me, but Luna said she could go home by herself and quickly left.


"I've been meaning to thank you for a long time, but at thihs age, my legs and back are not good enough to go out there. I am sorry."

"No, no, not at all. I did what I had to do."

"Oh, Luna is right, you are a generous man. Thank you, thank you......."


　Tungul rubbed his hands together and repeated his words.

　Now that the atmosphere has warmed up a bit, let's get down to business.


"I heard from Luna that this village is now plagued by orcs."

"...... Yes. It is a shame that the proud White Wolf Tribe should be plagued by such creatures."


　The white wolf tribe is probably the name of their clan.

　The ears and tail certainly resemble wolves.


"Have orcs lived nearby before?"

"No, they used to live far away from this village. However, due to a period of time when there was no rain, it seems that they had trouble finding food, so they moved here......."


　I see. So it wasn't only around the village of Jimari that was in need of food.

　However, if that is the reason, there seems to be little hope for the orcs to return to where they came from. No wonder they are worried.


"It would be better if they simply stayed in the same habitat area, but...... they are planning to attack our village. They are tough and numerous. There is no chance we can win."


　Tungul said with a dark look on his face.

　I saw a lot of old people and children in the village. If they all ran away together, they would become a target. If we can't reconcile, then we have no choice but to fight.


"Did you talk to the orcs?"

"They can speak, but other than that, they are no better than monsters. They see us only as prey."

"I see. So we have no choice but to fight."

"Yes......."


　I had a general idea of what was going on.

　The orcs were evil monsters that harmed people in Seven Knights Online, but that doesn't seem to have changed in this world either.

　If that's the case, then I can defeat them with peace of mind.


"Thank you for speaking with us."

"Oh, are you leaving already?"

"Yes, I think it would be better to take action as soon as possible."


　Tungul-san tilted his head at my words.


"What do you mean?"
 
"I will take care of the orcs. Please wait and rest assured."
