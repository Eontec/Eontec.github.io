Tl: Sam

…


---- and well, this happened before.


　I've thought about it a lot since then, and I've come to the conclusion that if I want to make someone stronger first, it should be Shea.

　She is a smart girl, but physically she is an ordinary girl. (Tl:  He wants to give power to the devil)

　She seemed to be working a lot for me recently in places I didn't even know existed, and that seems to have caused her to become fatigued.
<!--more-->


　She wouldn't stop even if I told her that she didn't have to work so hard. Then I thought it would be good to have a body that would not get tired no matter how much she moves. If she became stronger, she would be able to fight off bandits and other attackers again.


"......We're almost there."


　Luna, the beastman walking in the lead, said so.

　Luna and Shea and I were walking through a thick forest.

　The destination was the village where Luna lives. She said we were almost there, but there was no sign of people around us and there was no road. It didn't seem like there was a village at all.


"We have arrived. That's the village of Lulu. That's where I live."


　Luna pointed in the direction of the village, and sure enough, there it was.

　But it wasn't like a human village at all. Usually in human villages, trees are cut down and houses are built, but in their village, trees were used as they are and used as houses.

Of course, some trees were cut down to make open spaces, but this was minimal. They were like natives living in the jungle.


"Come on."


　I followed Luna into the village.

　It must have been the first time for a human being to come to this village. The beastmen living in the village were staring at us. The children were simply curious, while the adults were wary.


　It was only natural that they would be wary of someone like me in a heavy armor.

　While I was thinking about this, Luna's footsteps stopped in front of a house.

　It was a simple house made of wood. It was bigger than the other houses, so I wondered if someone important lived there.


"Wait a minute."


　Luna entered the house saying so.

　After about five minutes of waiting, Luna came out of the house. 


"The village chief says he is going to see Dyle-sama. Please do so."

"I see, it was the village chief's house. Well...... I'm going to talk to the village chief alone, so I want you two to kill some time at random. I don't have plans to do anything in particular today, so you can go ahead and play."

"Eh, but......"


　Shea showed no appreciation for my suggestion.

　Even when we were in the village of Jimari, she was more interested in helping me than playing with me. I'm happy that you want to be of help to me, but it's also important to have fun once in a while.

　Even though she made a new friend in Luna. I still don't know what she's talking about, but I often see them enjoying themselves in the village these days.


　Well, what should I do?

　I could at least have a discussion with the village chief by myself, so I wanted Shea to play and relax.

　But if I told her honestly, she wouldn't be convinced. I would have to come up with some kind of reason.


"Okay, Shea, I'll give you a job."

"Yes!　Anything!"

"We are still under the suspicion of the people of this village, and that's not good."

"Yes, it is."

"There. I want you to play nice with Luna and let people know that we are safe and not hostile. I can't do it this way. I can only ask Shea, who is still very young and is not very intimidating."

"Only I can ...... do this!　I understand, I'll take care of it!"


　Shea replied with full of motivation.

　Well, I managed to persuade her.


　But even though it was just an idea, it's a good one, isn't it?　I feel it's much more effective than my various other moves.


"Well then, I'll be counting on you, Shea."

"Yes!　Plese leave it to me!"

 
　Leaving Shea in a state of enthusiasm and Luna in a state of blank amazement, I went into the village headman's house.

Tl: Sam

…


"I'm sorry to bother you."

"Welcome."


　When I entered the house, I was greeted by a beastman.

　Like Luna, he had white hair. He was about sixty years old. He looked quite old.


"My name is Tungul. Please have a seat here."


　I sat down on the cushion placed in front of him as Mr. Tungul urged me.

　The beastmen in Seven Knights Online were a bit rough around the edges, but this man was quite calm and rational. It is dangerous to make assumptions based on in-game impressions.


"First of all, let me thank you. Thank you for saving Luna."


　Tungul-san bowed deeply.

　When I sent people back to their villages, I often sent them back with me, but Luna said she could go home by herself and quickly left.


"I've been meaning to thank you for a long time, but at thihs age, my legs and back are not good enough to go out there. I am sorry."

"No, no, not at all. I did what I had to do."

"Oh, Luna is right, you are a generous man. Thank you, thank you......."


　Tungul rubbed his hands together and repeated his words.

　Now that the atmosphere has warmed up a bit, let's get down to business.


"I heard from Luna that this village is now plagued by orcs."

"...... Yes. It is a shame that the proud White Wolf Tribe should be plagued by such creatures."


　The white wolf tribe is probably the name of their clan.

　The ears and tail certainly resemble wolves.


"Have orcs lived nearby before?"

"No, they used to live far away from this village. However, due to a period of time when there was no rain, it seems that they had trouble finding food, so they moved here......."


　I see. So it wasn't only around the village of Jimari that was in need of food.

　However, if that is the reason, there seems to be little hope for the orcs to return to where they came from. No wonder they are worried.


"It would be better if they simply stayed in the same habitat area, but...... they are planning to attack our village. They are tough and numerous. There is no chance we can win."


　Tungul said with a dark look on his face.

　I saw a lot of old people and children in the village. If they all ran away together, they would become a target. If we can't reconcile, then we have no choice but to fight.


"Did you talk to the orcs?"

"They can speak, but other than that, they are no better than monsters. They see us only as prey."

"I see. So we have no choice but to fight."

"Yes......."


　I had a general idea of what was going on.

　The orcs were evil monsters that harmed people in Seven Knights Online, but that doesn't seem to have changed in this world either.

　If that's the case, then I can defeat them with peace of mind.


"Thank you for speaking with us."

"Oh, are you leaving already?"

"Yes, I think it would be better to take action as soon as possible."


　Tungul-san tilted his head at my words.


"What do you mean?"
 
"I will take care of the orcs. Please wait and rest assured."
