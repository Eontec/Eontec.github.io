"I'm sorry to bother you."

"Welcome."


　When I entered the house, I was greeted by a beastman.

　Like Luna, he had white hair. He was about sixty years old. He looked quite old.


"My name is Tungul. Please have a seat here."


　I sat down on the cushion placed in front of him as Mr. Tungul urged me.

　The beastmen in Seven Knights Online were a bit rough around the edges, but this man was quite calm and rational. It is dangerous to make assumptions based on in-game impressions.


"First of all, let me thank you. Thank you for saving Luna."


　Tungul-san bowed deeply.

　When I sent people back to their villages, I often sent them back with me, but Luna said she could go home by herself and quickly left.


"I've been meaning to thank you for a long time, but at thihs age, my legs and back are not good enough to go out there. I am sorry."

"No, no, not at all. I did what I had to do."

"Oh, Luna is right, you are a generous man. Thank you, thank you......."


　Tungul rubbed his hands together and repeated his words.

　Now that the atmosphere has warmed up a bit, let's get down to business.


"I heard from Luna that this village is now plagued by orcs."

"...... Yes. It is a shame that the proud White Wolf Tribe should be plagued by such creatures."


　The white wolf tribe is probably the name of their clan.

　The ears and tail certainly resemble wolves.


"Have orcs lived nearby before?"

"No, they used to live far away from this village. However, due to a period of time when there was no rain, it seems that they had trouble finding food, so they moved here......."


　I see. So it wasn't only around the village of Jimari that was in need of food.

　However, if that is the reason, there seems to be little hope for the orcs to return to where they came from. No wonder they are worried.


"It would be better if they simply stayed in the same habitat area, but...... they are planning to attack our village. They are tough and numerous. There is no chance we can win."


　Tungul said with a dark look on his face.

　I saw a lot of old people and children in the village. If they all ran away together, they would become a target. If we can't reconcile, then we have no choice but to fight.


"Did you talk to the orcs?"

"They can speak, but other than that, they are no better than monsters. They see us only as prey."

"I see. So we have no choice but to fight."

"Yes......."


　I had a general idea of what was going on.

　The orcs were evil monsters that harmed people in Seven Knights Online, but that doesn't seem to have changed in this world either.

　If that's the case, then I can defeat them with peace of mind.


"Thank you for speaking with us."

"Oh, are you leaving already?"

"Yes, I think it would be better to take action as soon as possible."


　Tungul-san tilted his head at my words.


"What do you mean?"
 
"I will take care of the orcs. Please wait and rest assured."

…


　After talking with the village head, I left the house.

　The sun is starting to set a little. I decided to take it easy today and start work tomorrow.


"Now, where are Shea and the others?"


　I walked through the village looking for them.

　hm? I can't help but feel someone's eyes on me.

　It is true that I felt a lot of stares when I came to the village. However, it felt a little different from the way I felt at that time. At that time, I felt a strong sense of caution and hostility, but I don't feel so bad about this now.


　On the contrary, I sometimes even felt a sense of respect. What is going on?


"---- and at that time, Dyle-sama took a swing at the bad guys!　He rescued those who were being held captive brilliantly!"


　I heard a familiar voice.

　I turned toward it and found that Shea was speaking, to a crowd of beastmen.　Or was it a speech?


"...... what are you doing?"


　I approached the place with a bad premonition.

　Shea was talking about the time I defeated the bandits. I didn't tell her how I fought the bandits, so she probably heard it from Luna.


　Shea's storytelling was so impassioned that I couldn't help but listen in.

　The beasts, hungry for entertainment, were listening intently, and whenever Shea spoke passionately, they would shout, "Oh," or "Wow! and "Wow!


　Could this be the reason why they were staring at me earlier?

　If they hear me talk like this, they might start to admire me like a character in a story. Or rather, they are probably already in love with me.


　I was wondering what was wrong with me,


"----The evil bandits who tormented the people were successfully defeated. By the hand of Dyle-sama who is there!

"Yes."


　The eyes of the beastmen who had been listening turned to me all at once.

　And then they all rushed toward me at once.


"You were great, weren't you?　I respected you!"

"Yawn, yawn!"

"What kind of king are you?　Tell me!"

"Hey, hey Just calm down"


　The beastmen were making me squirm.

　I was finally released and set free after dark.



◇　◇　◇




"......Fu, I'm tired."


　Night.

We were staying in the cabin where Luna usually lives. 

　It's a small hut, so it was cramped for three people to sleep in, but it's nice to have something like this once in a while.


　By the way, Luna's parents had already passed away. So she often wandered around the forest alone, and was unluckily caught by the bandits.


"Now, let me ask you something, Shea. Why did you do that?"


　Shea looked like she had done her job.

　I was in a lot of trouble because of it. I'd like to complain about it.


"I had, of course, been telling everyone in the village how wonderful Dyle-sama was. He told us to be on our guard. If that was the case, I thought it would be quicker and more effective to tell them about the saga of Dyle than to show them how well Luna and I got along."

"I see."


　I did ask her to lower everyone's guard, but that was just a ploy.

　I just wanted to make sure that Shea and Luna relaxed.


"I'm sure Luna wasn't busy either, was she?"

"I was not.  Shea's story was interesting, and I wanted to hear more."

"Is that so...."


　Looked like she was enjoying it more than I thought.

　I feel like she did something unnecessary, but it is also true that the beastmen liked Shea because of her actions. 


I went from being a troublesome outsider to being treated like a hero all at once. - I'm not sure what to make of that.

　The first time I saw her, I was wondering whether I should scold her or not, when all of a sudden, she became very sad and her eyes started to get all moist.


"Did I ...... do something unnecessary?　I am so sorry ......."(Tl: The Devil, I say)


　Shea said in a voice that sounded as if she was about to start crying.

　Wait, I didn't expect this to happen. I had to comfort her in a hurry!


"No, it's not like that, Shea!　I couldn't come up with such a great plan. I'm so lucky to have such a brilliant person in my life!"

"Do you really think so, ......?"

"Ah! Of course!" 


　Fu, It worked out somehow.


"Um, so Dyle-sama. How did your discussion with the village chief go?"

"Oh, about the orcs. It seems to be more serious than I thought, and I think it's best to settle it as soon as possible. I want you two to get started as soon as tomorrow morning."


　When I asked this, Shea and Luna nodded cockily without hesitation.


"Of course. Anything you need, we're at your service."

"I'll do my best."

"Thank you, both of you. I'm counting on you."


　I went to bed with my two reliable allies.
