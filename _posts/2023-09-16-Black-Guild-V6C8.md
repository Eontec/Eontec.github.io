Tl: Sam

…


"Come on!　It's time for some fun, fun experimentation!"

　Maki operated a panel on the wall, and a mechanical platform appeared in the center of the room that seemed to have a variety of functions. There were several other futuristic devices in this room, the purpose of which was unknown.   
　I bet they all cost an eye-popping amount of money.

"Maki-san, you may examine Riri, but please don't do anything ...... violent, okay?"   
<!--more-->
Of course not, Tanaka-kun. This is a precious and valuable offering that only one person could have. I'll treat her with the utmost courtesy."

　Maki-san said with a smile on her face.   
　Well, I didn't trust him. She's the type of person who can't see what's going on around her when she's in the heat of the moment. I kept a close watch on her.

"Come this way, young lady."   
"Ri......"

　Riri was escorted to the platform and placed in the center of the room.   
　Riri was still a bit nervous, but she was obediently obeying Maki's instructions. It seems that she faithfully complied with my prior request that she remain quiet during the inspection. I had to reward her later.

"Assistant-kun! Come help me!"

　Maki shouted as she fiddled with the machine.   
　Then, a figure appeared from the door leading to the back of the room.
It was a large fellow, about two meters tall. Dressed in a white coat, the figure's shoulders are quite broad. On their face, they wore a mask with a pointed mouth...... a so-called plague mask.   
The eyes were covered with glass, so we couldn't see the face. I could guess 　that he is a man from his body shape, but other than that, I had no idea what else he looked like.

　The man looked at me, bowed his head, and began to help me prepare for the experiment.

"Maki-san, this person......."   
"He is my right-hand light arm, Sam, my first assistant. He's a quiet guy, but an excellent assistant, well, don't mind him." (Tl: Tch, I'm happy I'm sharing names with someone in this novel, but I'm annoyed it's a weirdo plague-plague docto doctor"   
"Haa ......."

　By the way, the woman who guided me here said she was the 'ninth assistant'. She seemed pretty smart, too, but still ninth. So this big guy must be pretty smart.   
　However, this Sam or someone like him, I felt a "presence" different from that of an ordinary person. I wonder who he is.

"...... Dr. Kurosu. Preparations are complete. We can begin analysis at any time."   
"I understand. Tanaka-kun, can you give us a cell sample before we begin?　As I recall, she can detach her own body, right?"
"Yes. Yes, I'll ask her."

　Riri often tears off her own body and feeds it to me. She doesn't seem to feel any pain in the act.

"Riri, can you do it for me?"   
"Riri, ......."

　I asked, and Riri reluctantly tore off a piece of her own buttocks and handed it to me.
　Apparently, she didn't want to tear off her own body part if I wasn't going to eat it. I thanked Riri and placed it in the glass container in Maki's hand.

"Hmmm, thanks for your cooperation, you two. This is a super valuable sample. Sam, please analyze it with the utmost care."   
"Yes, ma'am."

　Sam, the first assistant, placed Riri's cells into the huge machine and operated the control panel.   
　Maki-san approaches Riri on the table and begins to examine her with various instruments.

"We'll start with X-ray crystal structure analysis and optical spectral analysis....... Oh, and we can't leave out the magnetic wavelength analysis, either. Sam, don't forget to analyze the magiprotis."(Tl: Wow, real science words)   
"Yes, I have already done that. Already done."   
"Good."   

　The two of them were working in unison to find out more about Riri.   
　As Maki had declared at the beginning, she did not do anything that Riri did not want to do. On the contrary, she took care of Riri, feeding her and taking care of her physical condition.   
　I don't know if it was out of kindness or if she was taking care of Lili's physical condition for the sake of her research, but for the time being, nothing that I had been worried about seemed to be happening.   
　Riri, too, was relieved and curled up on her side.

"The analysis of the DNA structure is complete, Dr. Kurosu."   
"Thank you. Let's see......."   
"No dungeon rock was found. I think it is safe to assume that it is an independent individual after all."   
"That's great. That's great. My hypothesis was right after all."

　Maki-san smiled happily.   
　Her face is completely that of an evil scientist. It was hard to believe that she was from the government side.

"The cell culture is going well...... and this is about the only thing we can examine in the living body right now."

　Maki-san, who had been examining her for a while, said this and released Riri.   
　As I approached, Riri jumped at me.

"Riri!"   
"Oops, watch out. You did a good job."

　I caught Riri and patted her head to thank her for her hard work. I pat her on the head and thank her for her effort.

"Thanks to you, Tanaka, I was able to do some good research today. That's a big step forward."

　Maki-san, perhaps exhausted from the exertion of her work, approached me, dizzy.   
　However, the look in her eyes was a little scary.

"He was saying that our hypothesis was correct. Did you find out something important?"   
"Aah. It is known that monsters born in dungeons usually have a DNA structure similar to that of the dungeon."   
"The same DNA as in the dungeon?"   
Yes. Each dungeon has its own DNA, and the monster born in the dungeon inherits a part of that DNA. Just like a parent and its child."   
"...... Wait a minute. Does that mean dungeons are "living things"?"   
"Yes and no. Dungeons are still a mystery to us."

　Maki-san laughs happily.   
　If she doesn't know, then no one can answer the question yet.

"Well, let's just assume that the DNA of the dungeon is engraved in the monster. And that DNA is the proof that the dungeon binds the monster tightly. As you know, when the dungeon is destroyed, the monsters themselves die in a chain reaction."

　I know that too.   
　Breaking a dungeon not only stops the creation of more monsters, it also defeats the monsters that have already been created.

"Researchers believe that when a dungeon is broken, this DNA causes monsters to die. We call the DNA the 'dungeon lock,' the binding that the labyrinth puts on the monster. This is something that every monster born from the dungeon can have. But......"

　Maki looked at Riri in my hand.

"That child does not have dungeon lock. In other words, ...... that child is not bound to the dungeon. It is a completely independent life form."

　Hearing this, Riri tilts her head, "Ri? Lili tilted her head.   
　She probably doesn't know that she is a special being.

"Do you understand, Tanaka-kun? Do you know how great this is? Until now, it was thought that monsters could only be born in dungeons. But it was different. The child proved that monsters can exist on their own."

　Maki says excitedly.   
　Riri's existence certainly proves that it is possible for monsters to be born and live without relying on dungeons.

"I think of it this way. I believe that dungeons only create beings that are similar to monsters. So, the original monster must live somewhere.　At least, there is no such thing on earth. In other words ......"

　Maki-san looks me in the eye and speaks of his hypothesis.

"They live in a different dimension, a different world than here. That's where the dungeons and magical elements came from."


Tl Note: Just gave our site a new make over, coutsey a member Dave. You can probably find him in the comments. I'm done with my exams, but I didn't get a holiday so I'm stuck doing Engineering Drawing assignments, the author releases really slowly though, and that leavs me with soome free time. I'm taking novel reccomendations in the discord server. Aaaaand before I forget, I have 2 announcements    

- My Birthday is next friday, I wonder how I'll spend it, but I have class, so I won't have much time
- I'm thinking of posting My original novel, I've had it throuout this year, and I think I should share it. I cuuently have only 8 chapters down and I'm almost done with the first arc/volume. It'll also be donation based, so If you really wwant a new chapter so much, you could go on my patreon and ask for it. I was originally going to make it 2nd tier patren members only (You can check my patreon and you'll see), but a friend motivated me to post it out for free.
