…


　The night of the meeting with Maki.   
　I had been invited by Adachi to go to a certain restaurant.

"Yakiniku again, huh? What a lazy guy."

　It was a different restaurant from the one we had been to last time, and it looked like a reasonably priced one.   
　I wondered if the only choice in Adachi's mind was yakiniku, or if he thought I was a guy who would be in a good mood if he fed me yakiniku.   
...... Well, the second part was definitely true.
<!--more-->

"Um, I think I have a reservation under the name of Adachi. ......"

　When I explained this to the waitress, I was shown to a private tatami room in the back of the restaurant.   
　The room was filled with a smiling Adachi and a slightly fidgety Hoshino.
　Hey, hey, I didn't hear Hoshino was coming.......

"I'm glad you're here, Tanaka. Here, sit over there."

　Adachi pointed next to Hoshino as if teasing her.   
　This guy's having fun, isn't he?　Hoshino and I had a public kiss at the end of the last episode. Adachi must have seen it, too.   
　That's why he wanted me to sit next to him. He was harassing me like a junior high school student.

"Well...... excuse me for sitting next to you."   
"Hi!　Please, come in!"

　Hoshino's body shook as she replied.   
　It seemed that Hoshino was also concerned about what had happened. I tried not to remind her too much of that time, so I treated her naturally.

"KuKuku, you two are so passionate."

　Adachi teased me with a smirk as I sat down next to Hoshino.   
　Damn it, he's getting on my nerves.

"So, why did you call me out today?　You didn't call me here to make fun of me, did you?"   
"Don't get mad at me, I'm sorry. Of course I had you two here today for a proper reason."

　Adachi said that, he fished out his bag and took out a cardboard package from inside it.   
　He then opened the package and took out a shiny rectangular object from inside.

"It's ......."   
"Oh, it's an 『 Orichalcum Shield 』 that only channels with over 50 million subscribers can get. It arrived yesterday."

　Adachi put the shield on the table.   
　The shield was shining white and dazzling just by looking at it. In the center, there is a video playback mark engraved, and below it is written "Makoto Tanaka Channel. It certainly looked like something that had been sent to me.   
　I hadn't realized that the number of subscribers had increased that much.

"I think we just passed 10 million subscribers the other day, but it's already up to 50 million?"   
"Riri's momentum has been building ever since she came out. The only person who is missed by the monster is you. The response to the last home delivery has been amazing. It's still growing. ...... kuku kuku."

　Adachi smiled wickedly.    
　I'm totally relying on this guy. The channel's management is in good hands.

"It's amazing, There are very few Japanese who have an orichalcone shield!"

　It was Hoshino who shouted that loudly.    
　She was a D-tuber, and this shield was a dream come true for her.

"If you don't mind, would you like to hold this shield?"   
"I-Is that okay!? Please, please!"

　Hoshino shook her head so much that it looked as if it might come off.   
　She then held the shield and gazed at its surface in fascination. I'm glad she is pleased with it.

"Yes, let's take a picture as a souvenir. Come on, you two, come over."

　Adachi points his phone at us.   
　Then Hoshino leans in close to me and holds half of the shield in her hand. This quick switching is quintessential. I'm not good at this kind of thing, so I honestly respect it.

"Yes cheese with ....... Tanaka's expression is a little stiff, but that's okay. Oh, Yui is perfect, she has a nice smile. Tanaka, learn from her a little."   
"I'm fine with this."

　And as we were having that usual exchange, the drinks and food were brought in.   
　It seems that Adachi had ordered them first. The food that was brought to the table was all things I would like. It was as if he was reading my mind, which pissed me off.

"So today is a celebration of this plaque, is that right?"

　I ask Adachi after the toast.   
　I didn't feel like that was all there was to it today.

　My hunch was right, and upon hearing my words, Adachi smiled for the first time today and I don't know how many times.

"I have one more announcement ...... to make today, or rather, a proposal."   
"A proposal?"

　I nod my head.   
　The channel's management is in Adachi's hands. I'm not sure if there's anything I need to know about it now. As I was wondering this, Adachi said something that I had never imagined.

"Let's start up a company, Tanaka. With you as president, of course."
