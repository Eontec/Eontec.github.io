"What?　I'm the president!?"

　Adachi's unexpected words startled and confused me.   
　It's true that I had heard that we might corporatize before. I heard it would be better from a tax standpoint.

　I'm not familiar with those things, so I left it up to Adachi and tried not to interfere...... but if I were to become the president, that would be a different story. I couldn't just shake my head and say, "Yes?"

"I'm not sure what you're surprised about. There are only two employees at the moment, me and Tanaka. I'm not the one who should be president, am I?"
<!--more-->   
"No, it's too much to ask for me to be the president!　I'm telling you, I don't know the first thing about running a business!"

　Since I graduated from junior high school, I have been diving in dungeons.   
　I know a lot about dungeons, but nothing about anything else. There was no way I could be the president of a company.

　So I strongly denied that I was going to be the president, to which Adachi responded in a nonchalant manner, 

"No one expects you to be a good manager. You are a billboard for the guild, and being president is just a title. Even if you become president, you'll be fine as long as you continue to do what you've always done. I might ask you to deal with the big guys once in a while, though, just like a president."   
"Is it really okay to continue as before ......?"    
"The president of the company, I'd rather have you deliver more than ever and earn more popularity than ever. After all, we've already talked about a lot of things."   
"What things......?"

　When I was about to ask him what he meant, Adachi placed a long, thin object on the table.

　It was a sword.   
　No, if you looked at it closely, you would see that it was roughly made. It looked more like a toy than a forged sword.   
　And it looked somewhat like my sword.　I wondered what it was.

"Well, press here,"

　Adachi pressed a button on the hilt of the sword.   
　And then..,

"Jacquin!　Wagaryu kenjutsu, shin-tataki!"

　Suddenly, the sword emitted a sound effect and my voice.   
　After that, every time Adachi pressed the button, it would say something like, "You were strong, but you had the wrongopponent!"

"Oh, hey, what's this? It's just like a Sentai merchandise!"   
"It's just a prototype, but it's good, isn't it?　The product name is 『 DX Deluxe Shachiken sword 』, and I'm sure the boys of the world will be drooling over it!"

　Adachi said confidently.   
　Are you insane?　Who would want something like this?   
　The reproduction of the sword is indeed quite good. Children who like swords might enjoy it, but they shouldn't need my voice.....   
　They went to the trouble of cutting out my voice from the delivery to make this thing. Who would want it at all?

"Ah, Um!　Can I have that sword?　Of course I'll pay for it!"

　Hoshino's voice made me fall to my knees.   
　I can't believe there is someone who wants it this close to me. I can't believe someone would want it this close to me.

"Hoshino, are you serious?　Do you really want something like this?"   
"I'm sure it's obvious!　If I were a fan of Mr. Tanaka, I would definitely want it!　Ryota and Akari would definitely want one too!"   

　Hoshino insisted so with a sharp intake of breath.   
　Yeah....... I can't believe it. I can't imagine anyone wanting a sword with my voice on it.

"Haha, I'll give it to you for free if you're Yui.  Do you want three swords, including one for your sister and brother?"   
"Thank you very much!　Um, I'll pay you, so can you add two more for my mother and two more for ...... you know, for preservation and for viewing?"   
"Six in all...... okay. I don't know if I'll be able to get them all right away if the reservations go flat, but I'll definitely make sure I get four of them."   
"Thank you!"

　The deal for my sword toys is done, with me out of the picture.    
　I don't know what to look ...... like, my head is starting to hurt.

"When did you get this ...... stuff?"   
"This isn't all, okay?　I've also got other offers for key chains, badges, CDs, cosplay costumes, and even a character for a shadow game collaboration. Oh, and I have an audio recording next week, so keep it open."   
"Seriously, this has to be a bad dream ......"

　It seemed like a bad dream to me that my goods would be scattered all over the world.   
　However, if there are people who are happy with that...... well, I guess I'd just have to do it. I'm sure Adachi went through a lot of trouble to get to this point.

"I'll do it if you want me to be a decoration president. But are you okay with it?"   
"Hmm?　What?"

　Adachi tilted his head at my words.

"But you're already working, you know. Maybe you're doing okay now, but you can't manage a channel, a company, and merchandise while having a day job, can you?"   
"I'm not going to hire someone from the outside to do that. Don't worry, I'll hire an outsider so I won't be running the company by myself. Besides, I've already submitted my resignation from my main job. Ha ha....."
