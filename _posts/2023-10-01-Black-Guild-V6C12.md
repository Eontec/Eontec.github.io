"...... haa!?　You left the company?!"

　I was surprised out loud at his sudden coming out.   
　The company he works for is supposed to be one of the biggest and best companies out there. Unlike the Black Dog Black Dog Guild, there is little overtime, good pay, and a low turnover rate.   
　Besides, Adachi has a family. He has a beautiful wife and a lovely daughter. It's a picture-perfect family.

　I can't believe he would quit his job.

"I can't believe that you, who are so smart, would do such a thing. What on earth do you think you're doing?　Does your wife know about this?"    
Don't look so frightened, Tanaka. I didn't do it without thinking, and I told my wife about it.
<!--more-->

　Adachi said that and gulped down the sake in his mug.   
　I pressed Adachi further.

"Then why did you quit the company without consulting me? Did you think I'd be happy about that?"    
"You didn't think so, that's why you quit without telling me. I knew you would oppose it."

　Adachi said without taking offense.   
　Adachi was right. I would have opposed him if he had told me that he was thinking of quitting his job. If I were single, I would have been against it, but Adachi has a family. There was no way he could let go of his stable life.

"You're worried about my family, aren't you?　I know what you're thinking. I'm glad you care that much, though."

　Adachi said as he turned his serious eyes straight at me.

"I can wipe my own ass. I'm not going to leave my family in the dark just because I failed in business once. I have enough money to live on for a few years, and I have double and triple insurance in case the business fails."   
"Even so you didn't have to go that far. I'm not the type of person who wants to be a millionaire. You're not the type of person who wants to be a millionaire, and you could have done just fine the way you are."   
"I'm not sure I'd have done it that way. But this is what I've always wanted to do. You could call it a dream. My wife knew that, so she agreed with me.
Adachi, you're on......."    
"I don't gamble, which means I quit my job because I'm convinced this is a win-win situation. So ...... you stop worrying about trivialities and just look ahead. If you owe me even a small favor."

　Adachi said and finally smiled.   
　...... haha. After being told this much, I have no choice but to unclench my fists. I was going to hit him until his face changed shape and make him retract his resignation. (Tl: How much I wished this was a mistranslation)

"I talked a little too much. I think I drank too much."

　Adachi scratched his nose in embarrassment.   
　I kept to myself the thought that there was no way he could get drunk on this level, being an enlightened person.

"Are you sure you want to do this?"   
"You're so stingy, boss. Make me a good profit, will you?

　I responded to Adachi's words by clashing our beer mugs.   
　I had to do my best to make sure this idiot's family wouldn't have a hard time.

"So?　What's the first step in creating a guild?"   
"We've already taken care of all the complicated formalities. The rest is to decide whether or not to add an office and ...... employees. I can ask few peoplen ask my acquaintances to do the accounting and other formalities, but it would be great if there are a few people who can do the miscellaneous work for me."   
"I see.  I don't think all of them have found new employment."

　It must be hard to start working right after being released from that guild.   
　There must be some former employees who are enjoying a brief respite. I worked solo, so I don't have a lot of people close to me, but I at least have their contact information and they'll be willing to talk to me.

　As I was thinking about who to call first, Hoshino, who had remained silent until then, spoke up.

"Oh, um!　Talking about employees.... Is it fine if I become one?"    
""...... eh?""

　Not only me but also Adachi let out a stupid sound at the sudden suggestion.   
　I didn't think she was going to say that.
