"What are you talking about?　Hoshino is in college now and wants to join a big guild when she graduates, right?　There's no way she's going to join a weak guild that hasn't even gotten off the ground yet."   
"That was certainly my intention. But now my biggest dream is different. I want to work withTanaka-san!　Tanaka-san is the person I admire. So please, please, please!"

　Hoshino bowed her head and put her heart and soul into it.   
　The word "admire" in this case means not as a person of the opposite sex, but as an explorer. I didn't think she adored me this much. I was surprised.

　I'm honestly happy to hear that. However, Hoshino is a young person with a future, and I can't just accept her like Adachi did. It would be fine if she chose to join my guild after experiencing other guilds, but I wondered if it would be a good idea for her to join my guild from the very beginning.

　As I was struggling with my answer, Adachi, who couldn't bear to look at me, opened his mouth.

"If that's the case, you can do a part-time job at our guild. It's like a rough internship. You can work there for a while, compare it with other companies, and if you still like it here, you can join us. Hey, Mr. President."   
"Oh, yes. You're absolutely right."

　I jumped on Adachi's helping hand as fast as I could.   
　The guild's management would go on like this, I could feel it.

　Hearing Adachi's proposal, Hoshino thought for a moment and then nodded her head.

"I understand. Then I'll ask you to do that!"    
"Ah. I'm glad Hoshino is helping us out. I'm counting on you."

　Thus, a new member joined our guild.   
　The guild didn't even have a name yet, so it would be a little while before it was officially up and running.

"I've been thinking about asking you, but I'm glad you're coming to us. I'm so glad you're coming. A company of just two guys is just too dull for me, so I'm very grateful."

　Adachi was in a good mood as he drank his drink.   
　Was this his intention from the beginning? I was wondering why he even invited Hoshino, so that's what happened.

"I'm so happy for you. I'll order something expensive to celebrate.... hmmmm?　The button is not responding."

　Adachi said that deliberately and stood up. It seemed that he was going to call the shopkeeper directly.　

"I'm going to go to the restroom while I'm at it. Don't get too frisky just because I'm not here, okay?"   
"Go on and get out of here."

　I pushed Adachi out of the private room.
　The room was inevitably left with just the two of us, Hoshino and me.

　It was awkward..... I didn't know what to talk about when it was just the two of us. I felt like I was able to talk naturally until a while ago, but right before the confession happened, I had a hard time looking her in the eye and talking.   
　But, as an adult, I couldn't just sit here and be happy. I took a breath and looked at Hoshino who was sitting beside me.

"Hoshino, about the other day......"   
"Oh, uh, yes!"

　Hoshino reacted in a panic, her face turning bright red.   
　Then, just when I thought she had regained her composure, she looked up at me, half hopeful, half anxious. Oops, she was getting nervous.

"Please wait a little longer for my answer. I'll give you my answer when I'm ready. I'm sorry to make you wait, but ...... in return, I will never make Hoshino sad. I promise."   
"Yes, I understand. I'll wait for you ......♡."

　Hoshino stared at me with moist eyes.    
　She had big, round, dull eyes. It felt like I was going to be sucked in when I looked at them.

"Tanaka-san......"   
"Hoshino......"

　Our faces naturally moved slowly closer to each other.   
　As soon as I heard Hoshino's breathing, she slowly closed her eyes.

　Is that what this is about⁉?　As my heart skipped a beat, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

"Ji Ji ......."

　It was an eye peering at me through a gap in the door.   
　I couldn't see his face clearly, but there was only one person who would do such a thing.

"Hey, Adachi!　What are you looking at?"   
"Damn, you got me."


　Adachi came in with a disappointed look on his face.   
　How long has this guy been spying on us?　I didn't feel any sign of him at all.

"Look, don't worry about me, just go on and on. I've created a nice atmosphere for you."   
"You didn't respond to the button, that was an act, wasn't it?　Come here, I'm going to hit you until your face is deformed!"    
"Stop it!　That's no way to treat me!"

　Adachi ran away and I chased after him.   
　Our drinking session continued noisily until late at night.
