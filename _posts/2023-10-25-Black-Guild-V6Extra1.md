♪Relaxing BGM

"My wallet is in a tight spot again this month. Maybe I should change jobs after all. I'm sure I can find a good job ......!　I should go dungeon diving too!　If I become a famous D-tuber, I'll have lots of money, lots of fans, and I'll be irresistible!"

"What's the matter, Reiyu?　You have a creepy look on your face"

"What do you mean by "creepy",Maria?　I was seriously thinking about my future!"

"Sorry, sorry. So, what's your future?" <--more-->

"Well, listen and be surprised. I'm going to become a dungeon distributor, a D-tuber!　Then I can make money and be popular with the ladies!"

"Oh ......."

"What a subtle reaction!　My future plan is perfect, isn't it?"

"I'm sorry, Reiyu, but being a dungeon distributor is not such an easy job."

"......Eh?　But the recently famous Shachiken had over 10 million subscribers right away, you know?　If someone that dull can do it, I'm sure it'll be a piece of cake for me too!"

"It's scary how little you know about things, ....... Shachiken is an exception. The reason he became so famous is because he was originally a very talented person. You can't do what he did." (Tl: Ouch)

"Heh? Is that so?"

"You know nothing about him, so Reiyu, I'll explain about Makoto Tanaka a.k.a. Shachiken for you today."

"Thank you very much, Maria!　Explain it to me!"

"Oh, I understand. I'll be right at it......."

""Take your time!""



"Mr. Makoto Tanaka, also known as the Corporate Sword Saint, is a 25-year-old dungeon streamer. His weapon is a sword. He has unstoppable speed and strength that can lift mountains. He's a power + speed type swordsman." 

"Lifting mountains is ...... an exaggeration, Maria. There is no way anyone could do that."

"He really did it."

"Heh......?

This is the video evidence. This is the footage from the second dungeon delivery where he fought the Mount Dragon."

"Come on!"

"......, he's really throwing it. That's impossible."

"I'm glad you believe me."

"Hi ......!　I'm not afraid to say that!　But why is Shachiken so powerful?"

"That's because he used to work for the Black Guild. He's been forced to work in the dungeon since he was a little boy, and as a result, he's gotten too strong."

"I see, that's a more normal-sounding reason than I thought. Well, I wonder if I can be as strong as him if I stay in the dungeon as long as he does."

Ah, Yeah, you have a point. If you work 350 hours of overtime a month in the dungeon, you might be able to get stronger."

"Three hundred and ...... fifty?"

"Oh, Shachiken dives in the dungeon almost every day and has been under the line of death for almost 10 years. If you can stay in the dungeon for the same amount of time, you might have a chance."

"Don't be silly!　If I do that, I'll die!　I won't even have time to watch anime!"

"Is that what you're concerned about? ...well, that's fine. That's why normal people can't be as strong as Shachiken. He was in the deep. There are very few people who can survive there alone."


"I see. ...... but that guild is terrible!　It's better to destroy it as soon as possible!"

"Don't worry Reiyu. The Black Dog Guild that Shachiken was in has already been shut down and its president has already been caught. He's been charged with a lot of other crimes, so he won't be able to come out for a while."

"That's great"

"Yeah. On the other hand, Shachiken seems to be on a roll these days. His suscriber count has exceeded 10 million and he is becoming the most famous individual in Japan. There are rumors that he is planning to start a new guild." (
TL: Gossip spreads wayy too fast)


"That's awesome!　I wonder if I can be a part of it?"

"I thought you were going to be your own distributor.　They might hire you for clerical work, but I don't think they're going to hire Reiyu, who doesn't ...... have any particular qualifications.'

"That's... not good"

"Such is Shachiken, but he reported on social media that he's going to attack a large dungeon next time. I'm also paying a lot of attention to where he will dive. I'm looking forward to it."

"I'm going to try to watch the dungeon stream too!　I'll study his dungeon steaming with that!"

"That's a good mindset, man. I'm sure you'll get hooked on Shachiken's delivery because it's so interesting." (Tl: Shachiken is helluva drug)

"Hey Maria, tell me more about Shachiken. I'm getting curious!"

"Okay. He is not only strong, but also has interesting ...... love relationships. He has several women interested in him."

"How many?　He is irresistible!　I'm jealous!　I want to be irresistible too!"

"Wow, don't talk so loud. Should I not have brought this up?"

"I want to hear more of that!　Please say the details!"

"He is a selfish man. But I'm running out of time, so I'll tell you all about it in the next video."

"Mwu...... got it. I'll be standing by naked."

"You're not wearing any clothes to begin with."

"Well, yeah." 

"Well, that's it for this commentary. Watch the next video!"

"Don't forget to Like and Suscribe"

""Thank you for watching!""

Tl Note: I didn't drop the novel. I've just been very occupied with some stuff at school. I've been getting some free time recently and I can translate a bit. The releases will be slower, but now I'm behind the author, so I can have a proper release schedule which will be twice per week, with extra sponsored chapters(No more than 3 per week) if I get donations. The authour has corrected the problem with the Volume numbers on the raw site, so I need your opinion on if I should change that to reflect here too, but that will take quite a lot of work, including fixing everything on NU. I'll also be more active on discord. Also check out my original novel.
