Tl: Sam

…


"We have been waiting for you, Tanaka-sama. Please come this way."   
"Yes, thank you very much."

　I arrived at the entrance of the Yoyogi World Tree dungeon and was guided by a uniformed person into the barrier that sealed off the dungeon.   
This person is an employee of the Department of Dungeon Management. All the labyrinths that appear in the area are managed by the Labyrinth Management Bureau.

"...... I apologize for calling on you at such short notice. The government officials who are available at the moment could not even investigate. We rely solely on you, Tanaka-sama."

　The official said that in a voice so quiet that the drone could not hear him.   
　In fact, this dungeon raid was suddenly decided yesterday. If it were up to us, we would have made more careful preparations before entering the dungeon.

"No, it's fine. I'm free anyway."

　So why did they decide to go today?
　It was because this dungeon was reported to be active.

　According to the report, the concentration of magical elements in this dungeon had increased dramatically, and the monsters in the dungeon were also becoming more active. A dungeon where this kind of phenomenon occurs has the possibility of transforming into a unique dungeon. That is why they moved up the date of my exploration.   
　This time, I have already received permission to destroy the dungeon. If this dungeon turns out to be a unique or dangerous one, Dojima-san said I could destroy it.

　There are dozens of unique dungeons in the world, but there has only been one case of destruction. In other words, the case where I defeated Shoggoth was the only one. That's probably why Dojima-san asked me to destroy it.

"You can go to the bottom from here......."   
"I see, this is quite ......."

　In the place I was led to, there was a large hole that led underground.   
　In the hole, there were many roots of the world tree. It seems that one could walk deep into the hole by following these roots.

　I could not find any foothold other than the roots, so I could say that it was a very difficult dungeon, but that was not what I was interested in.

"The concentration of magical elements in the upper level is so high. I haven't seen a dungeon this dense since the Imperial Palace dungeon."

　I had not felt such a high concentration of magic element in the shallowest layer since that dungeon.   
　An inexperienced explorer might get intoxicated just by entering this place. If the concentration of magical element is this high in the upper levels, I wonder how strong the monsters will be in the deeper levels. It's a little worrisome.

"What will you do......?　It was reported that Chief Amatsuki would be available in the evening. We can wait for that and then do the investigation."   
"No, ...... it's fine. I'd like to save as much time as possible right now."

　It would be quite reassuring if Amatsuki could come, but this dungeon is still growing. It would be better to dive in as soon as possible. Besides, it's harder to escape when there is an emergency if you have friends.

　Considering the possibility of only having to investigate, solo is the easiest way to go.   
　I'm used to it that way.

It would be safer to go down this thick root. But the survey team couldn't "even reach the middle level. And ...... eh?"

　I held up my hand to stop the management office person from talking.

"I'm afraid you'd better get back, sir. It looks like they've already detected us."
"What?

　I heard the sound of something scraping against the ground.   
　It was the sound of large, long creatures moving on the surface of the tree roots. They appeared to surround the two of us as they flicked out their long tongues.

　They were huge snakes with purple scales. I estimated that they were more than 10 meters long.   
　There were about 30 of them. Their fangs curled around the roots of the trees, and purple liquid dripped from their fangs.

"Is that the Venom Serpent?　　So many A-rank monsters ......!"   
"Looks like this is already their territory."   
"But this place should have still been safe, and yet this is happening!"   
"That's how active they've become. It's a good thing we came early."

　I drew my sword and readied it.   
　Now, let's see,

"----, we will now begin our business."
Tl Note: I've corrected the Volume numbers with this release, I'll try to get everything rectified on Novel Updates. Quite an inconvenience
