『 Shaaaaaaaah ！！』

　One of the Venom Serpents let out a loud cry to intimidate me.   
　It seems that it had finished its assessment of me and recognized me as its prey. The other side had 30 Venom Serpents, and this side had two, including the staff member (well, Riri was there, too). It was obvious to everyone which of us had the advantage.

"Hi-hii-hii-hii-hii-hii-hi!"

　The staff member screamed and, unable to bear it any longer, turned his back and tried to run away.   
　Immediately, a Venom Serpent leapt at him, aiming at his back. It is an ironclad rule that you should never turn your back on a wild animal, and it is no different when dealing with a monster.
<!--more-->

　I swung my sword straight at the Venom Serpent as it leapt toward him.

"Waga-ryu kenjutsu, matataki(Blink)!"(Tl: Previously mistranslated as "shun" because of the Kanji, I should probably use the english translations)

　The Venom Serpent's head was cut off with a flash of the sword.    
　The headless torso fell with a thud onto the roots, and after wiggling around for a while, it fell to the bottom of the hole.

「Oooooh!　he beat it!」   
「That's what I'm talking about, Shachiken!」  
「One hit lol」   
「Well, the opponent is only A-rank after all」   
「No, A-rank monsters are usually very strong. ......」   
「Shachiken is the strongest! Shachiken is the strongest!」   
「But there are still nearly 30 of them. Can he make it?」   
「I'm also worried about the unstable footing.」   
「I mean, this is the upper level. Only Shachiken can take them down.」  

　I was hoping that if I killed one of them, the others would run away, but unfortunately that didn't happen.   
　Either they were taking revenge on us, or they were just hungry. The Venom Serpents didn't run away, but instead approached us jitterily.   
　There seems to be no other way but to do it.

"Officials. Don't turn your back and run away by retreating slowly. I'll take care of the rest."   
"Ha, Yes. Thank you very much. I wish you good luck. ......!"


　The staff member retreated as I told him to, and then exited the dungeon and closed the barrier.

"Now I'm alone. Now you can fight to your heart's content."
"Teke!　Riri!"

　Riri protested as she emerged from her breast pocket.   
　She seems to be angry too.

「Riri, you look so cute when you're angry.」   
「Actually, Shoggoth is rank EX, so she's ranked higher than Venom Serpent.」   
「But she's still just a baby.」   
「When she grows up, she'll become the strongest ally.」   
「Riri-tan haha」   
「Fungurui Fungurui (a voice that the brain refuses to understand)」   
「No, I bet you Riri will grow up to be a downer type of heavy beauty.」   
「I bet Suda's life on it too.」   
「Suda's life is on the line lol.」

"I'm sorry, Riri was with me. I'll fight with you then."   
"Riri!"

　Riri enthusiastically looked at the Venom Serpent with me.   
　They approached us and attacked us at once.

The first one to bare its fangs.

　The first one bared its fangs to bite me.   
　A purple liquid was dripping from its fangs. Of course, it was highly poisonous, toxic enough to kill even a large monster in an instant.   
　I leapt to dodge the bite and thrust my sword over my head at the top of his head, right into his brain.   

"Yo, tsu! "(Tl: It’s been 8 volumes, but yeah, these are like deep breaths and grunts they make as they attack)   
『 Ja! ！？』

　No matter how strong your body is, you can't survive if your brain is pierced. His body was still twitching, but he would soon stop moving.

 <div data-nat="424166"></div>

「It's too quick lol.」   
「As usual, he's still as strong as ever.」   
「He's already killed one before I know it.」   
「But there are more of them.」   
「He won, I'm going to the bathroom.」(Tl: Why does this guy only watch when he’ll need to  use the toilet)

『Jaaaaaaaaaaa ！！』

　The Venom Serpents, perhaps annoyed that two of their friends were killed, attacked from all directions at once. Even if one of them gets killed, they probably think that if one of them were to bite someone, the venom would take them down.   
　However, with this level of numbers, I can handle them.

"Wagaryu kenjutsu, Mujinzan(Infinite Slash)."

　Countless sword flashes ran through the air, cutting down the Venom Serpents one after another.   
　As the name implies, Mujinzan is a cerebral technique that unleashes an endless rain of slashes. Although the power of each hit is inferior to that of Matataki(Blink), it is overwhelmingly superior in terms of sheer numbers.   
　It is a very effective technique when there are many opponents.

「Wha - What's going on?」   
「I can't see his arms or sword because he's too fast!」   
「Venom Serpent-kun, your shaking lol.」   
「I didn't know he still had this kind of skill!」(Tl: Definitely not his only rapid fire attack though)   
「There's only a little more left!」

　After cutting down most of the Venom Serpents that attacked me, I stopped my arm for a moment.   
　The three remaining Venom Serpents became more wary of their dead comrades and moved away from me. Now, as I was thinking about how I would take care of the rest ......, the Venom Serpent that was behind me suddenly accelerated and attacked.

『 Jaaaah！！』

　I turned around and was about to swing my sword, but sooner than that, Riri jumped out of my breast pocket and onto my shoulder.

"Riri!"

　Then, from under her eyes, where a normal creature would have a mouth, she shot out a stream of black liquid!   
　The Venom Serpent, after being hit in the face with the liquid, screamed in agony, 『Gishaaaaaaaaa ！？』 and then falls to the ground.   
　The part that was hit by Riri's liquid has melted into a sludge. Wow, that looks painful.

「...... Eh?」   
「Hii.」   
「Riri is too strong!」   
「When did you become able to do something like that?」   
「As expected of an EX rank.」   
「Oh, my God!」   
「Yea!　Yea!」 (A terribly muffled excited voice)   
「Riri, you're a shoggoth, aren't you?」

　The comment section was abuzz with excitement.   
　I bet they didn't expect Riri to be this strong.

Tl Note: Two Chapters today instead of 1, I'll post another chapter later in the week. If you look around the site, you'llnotice some ads; I've tried to make the annoyance as little as possible. You'll see 2 popups per page or per 2 minuites, just close them and continue reading, Then there's one ad in the middle of the chapters, and the ads at athe bottom.
