Tl: Sam

…


“Riri!”

　Riri proudly puffed out her chest (?) after defeating the Venom Serpent. Riri was proud of herself.   
　I immediately took out a bottle of sweetened beverages that I had brought with me and fed it to Riri.

"You did well. Great job!"   
"Riri~♡♡"

　Riri squealed happily.
<!--more-->

　I had been secretly teaching Riri some tricks at home.   
　At first, it was only things that a dog would do, such as "sit" and "wait," but then, perhaps because she wanted to please me, Riri began to show me more than that.   
　One of them was the "acid shot," which she had just performed.   
　Shoggoth, which I had defeated before, was covered with a special acid. It was so powerful that it melted away in an instant when a weapon touched it.   
　Riri is able to create a similar acid in her body and fire it. Thanks to her training, her speed and aim were excellent. It is a weapon that can be used against monsters in the dungeon.

"Well, we're still at the entrance, so let's take down the rest of them quickly."   
"Riri!"   
『Shuru......』

「Venom Serpent, you're struggling lol」   
「Of course I'd be scared if my friends were being melted into mush.」   
「You've been playing with the wrong guy.......」   
「Riri's acid is worse than the poison you're so proud of,」   
「What are you going to do, I don't know how to attack Shachiken from a distance anymore」   
「I guess it doesn't make much difference since Shachiken can send slashes flying, right?」   
「Either way, he's a total shit boss.」   
「I feel sorry for the monsters he encounters」   
「Nerf him!」 

"Yo, ho."

　I took advantage of their hesitation to attack and took out a few more Venom Serpents.   
　As I was about to go below to take down the remaining one, it opened its mouth and sprayed a large amount of purple liquid from the tip of its sharp fangs.   
　The liquid flew straight at me and hit me.

「What?」   
「That poison can fly!」   
「Oi oi oi, I'm dead, Tanaka.」   
「Shachiken!」   
「Oh, Tanaka, it's a pity that he's dead.」   
「Of course he's dead!」   
「No, he's definitely not dead.」   
「He even took the poison on purpose.」

　The poison covering my body fell to my feet according to gravity.   
　The poison, which can enter the body through the skin and easily kill large organisms, did not work on me. I got a little in my mouth, but nothing serious. I've eaten the Venom Serpent several times, so I've developed a tolerance to it.   
I think Riri would be fine with this level of venom, but just in case, I protected her with my hand so she wouldn't get hit.

"Phew, that's a little bitter."

「Bitter lol.」   
「He didn't eat it after all!」   
「I knew it.」   
「Well, he did eat the shoggoths.......」   
「Venom Serpent, you're so upset.」   
「I bet you thought you'd won, didn't you?」   
「You're out of luck. ......」   
「Oh, I got cut.」   
「I'm so glad it was all over so easily.」   
「The last blow was painful.」   
「Did he kill them all?」

　With the last one down, I picked up my loot.   
　Some had fallen down the hole, but some remained on the roots.   
　Venom Serpent fangs, scales, and flesh. Now that I have created my own guild, I would be able to sell things from the dungeon. Up until now, I've been letting things go unless they were materials for weapons or restorative potions, but from now on, I'll have to pick them up more often.

"Oh, there's some good cuts of meat here. Do you want some too, Riri?"   
"Riri!"

　Riri ate the Venom Serpent's meat with a satisfied look on her face.   
　There was a trace amount of poison in the meat, but it didn't seem to be a problem. It seems that Riri had a high tolerance to poison.

"Okay, then, let's get going....... hmm?"

　As I was about to jump down from the roots, I saw a black object at the edge of my vision.   
　A rectangular object buried in the roots of the dungeon. It was about 30 centimeters in size, black and translucent, with a machine-like object visible through it.   
It would be easier to understand if I say that it resembled a HDD hard disk drive.

"I wondered if I should retrieve...... the labyrinthine information terminal archive in such a shallow place."

　I put it in my suit pocket and retrieved it.

「Hmm?　What's this?」   
「A machine?」   
「It's a labyrinth information terminal archive. Why is it here?」   
「This is a mysterious object that stores dungeon information. The monster names and ranks are all based on the labyrinth information terminal archive.」   
「What?　Someone isn't naming them?」   
「Yes, the government names the named monsters and so on, but the names of the races are all taken from the labyrinth information terminal archives.」   
「As I recall, magic usage was also recorded in the labyrinth information terminal archive. If it weren't for this, dungeon exploration would have been a lot slower.」

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

　As has been said in the comments, various information is stored in this labyrinth information terminal archive. Most of its contents are not yet known to earthlings. The information inside is proven to be correct, even though it's highly suspicious, so mankind is relying on it.

　Therefore, even monsters that mankind has not yet encountered are preserved in the records. We know the names, strengths, and characteristics of monsters we have never seen before.   
　However, while anyone can access the data on ordinary monsters, information on dangerous monsters and those yet to be identified is restricted and not available to everyone.

　Of course, Amatsuki and Rin are government officials, so they have access to all information managed by Japan.

　This is why the labyrinth information terminal archive is so valuable.   
　Basically, it is a rule to hand them over to the government, but they are often traded at a high price behind the scenes. It is always beneficial to monopolize information.

　It seems that major countries in the world have signed a treaty to share the information in the labyrinth information terminal archives, but I doubt that all the information is shared. No country would want to easily share information that they risked their lives to obtain.

　Incidentally, the information in the labyrinth information terminal archives is random, ranging from highly valuable information to information that is already generally known and of little value.

"I hope there's some good information in there, but I guess I'll have to wait until I get back."

　I muttered to myself as I stood at the edge of the root.   
　I looked down and saw that the hole went all the way to the bottom. It was too dark to see how far down the hole went.

　I guess it would be safer if I went down through the roots, but if I did that, I would never be able to get to the bottom of the hole. We should go that way as usual.

「No way.」   
「I've been waiting for this.」   
「What's going to happen?」   
「Time to sober up!」   
「I'm gonna get sick!」

　With a flip, I jumped down from the roots and began to fall toward the end of the dungeon.
