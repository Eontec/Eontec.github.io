Tl: AN0UR

The next morning.

I woke up to the sound of little birds.



...... yawn."



　I opened my eyes after a pleasant slumber.

　Phew, I slept well. The fact that I can wake up easily is probably the most beneficial part of being in this body.
<!--more-->



　In the real world, I had nightmares because of my trauma, and I rarely woke up with a good feeling. In this body, however, I have never even had a nightmare.

　My belly, which had been bulging out, has also retracted, and my body feels light. It's all good.



Now, it's time to get up and go to .......



　And then, I noticed something was clinging to my body.

　I looked over there and to my surprise, Shea-chan was sleeping on my right arm, clinging to it. Luna-chan was clinging to the opposite arm, and I was sandwiched between them.



We were apart when I went to bed, but when did you guys come?



　When I woke up, I thought it was awfully warm. I was holding on to two natural hot water bottles, so that would explain the warmth.



"Hey, wake up!"



　I shook Shea-chan's shoulder, who was sleeping peacefully.

　I'm sorry to disturb you while you're sleeping comfortably, but I have something to do today. I had to get her to wake up.



　After a while of rocking and poking while talking to her, she slowly opens her eyes.

　Then she stares at me with unfocused eyes.



'...... Huh?　Why is Dyle-sama here?　And what is this place?"

　Shea-chan looked like she was still sleeping.   
"You came to the village of Luna yesterday, didn't you?"

"But didn't we sleep in separate bedclothes?　Maybe Dyle-sama is in my comforter ......!

"No, you came under my duvet, didn't you?"



　to shea-chan, who was making dubious deductions.

　Then she said, "Huh!　I'm sorry!" and she lets out a loud voice. with her face as red as a tomato.



"Ugh, I'm so embarrassed. ......"

　I saw an interesting side of Shea-chan. Can I share it with Luna-chan?

　She looked red and loud.



　The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help.

　The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing. 

  I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that. The morning is totally lively.




I woke up and started to look around.




　I woke up and went into the forest with only Shea.

　I had gained a mysterious popularity because of yesterday's incident, so when I left the house, I was surrounded by beastmen and it was very difficult. 
  
  I thought She might have a talent as a bard, too.




"...... Now, Shea. I'm going to do something now, and I want to ask you something. 

"Yes, what is it?"

Shea said, "What we are going to do will probably make her 'stronger. Not compared to other children her age, but much stronger than adults.

Yes, you can do that. ......"



　The level difference between children and adults is about five.

　If you raise it by 10 levels, it will be much stronger than an adult.



"If you make Shea stronger, it will be impossible for her to live as a normal village girl. So I want you to decide, will you stay away from me and live as a normal child, or will you become strong and stay by my side?"



　It would seem wrong to ask such a question to a child.

　But Shea is a child who is smarter than adults. She will weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the two paths and come to a conclusion.



　But she didn't need to weigh the pros and cons of the two paths,



"I'm not going to be of any use to you. I would do anything to be of service to Dyle-sama".

"---- I see."

　I had expected this, but it's still quite heartbreaking.   

  I'm not sure if I can change his mind if I use a conversion conversion.   

　But if you do that and fail, it could break Shea's heart, which is too risky an action to try.

　I'm going to ...... make up my mind.


"I understand. I'll accept your loyalty."   

"......!　Thank you!"

Shea-chan’s face lit up with joy.
　
I'll have to make her stronger so she doesn't get hurt.

"The truth is that it's not really a good idea to be a part of a group. May I make a suggestion?"

"What is it?"

"Now that you're going to make me stronger, would it be okay if I ask you to make Luna stronger too?"

"Luna?"


　I wasn't expecting her to say something like that.
　
  It's true that if you make her stronger, she will protect the White Wolf Tribe.


"Why Luna too?"

''Luna-chan also wants to work for Dyle-sama. Please do!"

"Nn......I don't think Luna-chan is thinking that way, but if Shea-chan says so much......"

"Thank you!"


　I don't think Shea-chan would say that without thinking.
　
"Okay, then let's bring Luna and get started."


"Yes!"
