Tl: Sam

…

　I jumped down from the roots and descended swiftly down to the depths of the World Tree dungeon.   
　Hmmm, it was deeper than I had expected. It was pitch black below, and I couldn't see the bottom yet.   
　Sometimes a large root blocked my way, so I occasionally dodge or slash my way down.

「Aaaaah!」   
「Too long!」   
「Oops!」   
「Ororororo」   
「Fun!」   
<!---more-->
「You guys need to work on your semicircular canals more ...... uppu.」   
「So many soft guys, is this your first time here?」   
「You guys need to work on your semicircular canals lol.」

　I was going to do something about it, but Adachi stopped me. I heard that it is one of the contents.   
　Hmmm, I don't understand. The stream is full of mysteries.

"Nn?"

　I saw something moving at the bottom.   
　Is that a ...... root?　One root moved wiggly and pointed its tip toward me.   
　Then, the tip opened like a mouth.

"Is that a tree dragon or something rare?"

As its name suggests, a tree dragon is a dragon whose body is made of trees.    
They appear in dungeons with a lot of plants and usually mimic trees.    Whenever a explorer passes near them, they suddenly open their mouths and attack.

　Other tree-mimicking monsters include treants, but tree dragons are much nastier than treants.   
It has a hard body and high vitality. It is indeed a dragon.

"It's so ...... troublesome."

　I was surrounded by tree dragons on all sides before I knew it.   
　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　  　More than a dozen tree dragons were aiming at me, baring their fangs and attacking me.

「What the hell are these guys?」   
「Are tree dragons supposed to swarm like this?」    
「These guys are A-rank like the Venom Serpent, but aren't they in the wrong place?」   
「There's nowhere to run!」   
「But Shachiken will do it, won't he?」   
「I'll give a hand to poor Tree Dragon-kun.」

　I controlled my posture in mid-air, adjusted my stance, and gripped the hilt of my sword.   
　Then one of the tree dragons came to bite me.

『Gaaaah ！』

　A moment before the tree dragon's fangs hit me, I kicked in the air and ・・・・・・ evaded it. Then, I got on top of my opponent, pulled out my sword, and cut his head in two. 

「Yeah, yeah, yeah!」   
「You're moving in the air!」   
「Why are you moving in the air like that?」   
「You're using the six techniques?」   
「You're a moonwalker!」   
「Double jump ...... was it implemented in the real world too?」   
「Seriously, how do you do that?」   
「It breaks the laws of physics.」   
「What can't you do?」   

　Some people are surprised, but I think jumping in the air is a skill that anyone can do once they get the hang of it.   
　Air has a unique viscosity....... If you can feel it with the soles of your feet, and kick up well, you can lift your body up.   
　See?　It's easy, isn't it?   

『Gyuoooooooooo！！』

　The tree dragons became furious after their comrade was killed.   
　They attack all at once, but the only way they can attack is to bite or wrap themselves around you. Even if I didn't have a foothold, I didn't have a problem.   

"Good ...... hey!"

　I caught the head of one of the tree dragons and threw it away to hit the other tree dragons. The recoil from the throw allowed me to avoid the bite of the other individual, and I drove my sword into its brain.

"Phew, there are a lot of them indeed."

　Each one isn't that strong, but they appear one after the other, making it a hassle.   
　You can ignore them and move on, but it's also troublesome to have them chasing after you from behind. Let's just get rid of them all at once.   
　I jumped once and took the top of the tree dragons.   

"Wagaryu Kenjutsu, Amatsukaze・Jinsen."

　After twisting my body as hard as I could, I swing my sword downward with all my might.   
　Then a huge tornado is generated and fills the dungeon.

『 Gyuua！？』

　Each of those winds becomes a sharp blade.   
　The mass of giant blades go gurgling through the holes in the dungeon like a drill, shattering the tree dragons in its path into pieces.   

「t's too much lol.」   
「I didn't know you also had AOE attacks......」   
「This is already a natural disaster.」   
「I think I'll name it the Shachiken Cyclone.」   
「Bye bye, Tree Dragon-kun ......」

　When the typhoon passed, the tree dragons and the tree roots were gone.   
　Now there is nothing to block my way. I gracefully resume my fall.

".....I have no time"

　I have nothing to do, so I lay down and continue to fall.   
　I was surprised by the blow I had received earlier, but I was not attacked by any monsters after that.

　After a few minutes of safe fall, the ground comes into view.

"Oh, it's over."

　Returning to my stance, I plunge one hand into the wall of the dungeon.   
　Gah-gah-gah!　I slowed down and landed safely on the ground. It's been a long journey.

"This is ......"

　There was one road leading to where I landed. Walking down that road, I arrived at an open space.   
　There was also a large underground lake there. There were no monsters in sight, and it looked safe.

"A safe area, perhaps?"

　There are places in the dungeon where monsters do not appear. It does not mean that monsters will never come in, but there are places where monsters avoid. These are the places where the explorers can take a break.

"Okay, I'll take a break here then. I'm sure you viewers are tired too, so please take a break. I'll have some food while you're at it."

「Thanks for the break.」   
「We've been doing this all day.」   
「I'm going to the bathroom」   
「I'm going to get some sleep.」    
「This is going to be a long show, so it's important to take a break.」    

"Well, I'm going to have lunch...... and I'm going to cook with this Venom Serpent meat."

「I'm starting to enjoy this.」   
「This is not the time to go to the bathroom!」   
「Are you going to give me a break?」   
「I think it's more like the main story.」   
「I'm just wondering why the number of viewers has started to increase.」   
「Thank God for dungeon food!」   
「Only in Shachiken can we see the monsters eating.」   
「I've been waiting for this!」   

　I set the table and put the Venom Serpent meat on it.   
　It's still fresh since I just took it. This is going to be a delicious dish.

"I like it grilled with salt and herbs...... and then some soup. The rest is ......."

　I'm thinking about the menu. I'm getting hungry.   
　While the viewers were getting excited,...... it happened.

　Pitter-patter.

"...... hmm?"

　Suddenly, I hear the sound of water dripping in my ears.
　I thought it was water falling from above, but it was not. I looked back in wonder.

　There, I saw a mysterious life form that had emerged from the ...... subterranean lake to the surface.

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

"............"

　In a word, it was a "fish man."   
　It was covered with green scales all over its body, and had fins and gills on its body. His face was completely fish-like, and his physique was quite good. He was more than 6 feet tall and had well-developed muscles.

　I have never seen such a monster.   
　It clearly looked alien and abnormal.

　 It slowly moved its eyes and caught me.
　While I was on the lookout for what it was going to do, it suddenly moved at high speed and hit me with all its might.   

"What?"

　I quickly defended myself with both arms.   
　The power of his arms was so great that even though I defended myself, my body was sent flying backwards.

"Oh, stay!"

　I landed with a thud even as I flew backward.   
　The spot where I was hit hurts like a zing. It didn't hurt to move it, but I hadn't been hit this hard in a long time.   

「What?　What is that guy?」   
「Eh, it's too scary.」   
「I looked it up, but there's seriously no data on it.」   
「Is it a new species!」   
「What's more, it's so strong, I've never seen Shachiken get blown away before...」   
「I'm suddenly getting scared.」   
「That speed and power ...... surely ranks above S.」   

　The comments were getting noisy.   
　It was a clear anomaly. It's understandable.

　But I was more curious than scared.

"Nice ......, I'm going to get my first good workout in a while."

　Without drawing my sword, I approached the fishman with my fists clanging.
