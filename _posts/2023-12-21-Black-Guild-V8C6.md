Tl: Sam


…



"Gwooooo ......." (Tl: This immediately strikes me as strange, cuz these are regular quotes, not monster quotes that we see usually)

　The fishman let out a low roar as I approached him.   
　He seemed to be very wary of me. He bareed his fangs and threatened me.

"Gah ...... ah!"

　The fishman jumped out of the water as if he were a weir.   
　Clenching his right fist tightly, he came at me.

「Here it comes!」   
「Too fast!」   
「Too scary, lol!」   
<!--more-->
「What the hell is this guy!」   
「Can you get it, Shachiken?」

　I blocked the fishman's fist and slipped into his arms.   
　He had strong arms, but his fighting style was rough and poor. I don't know if he's intelligent, but at least he didn't learn any martial arts.

"Ha!"

　In return, I punched the fishman in the stomach as hard as I could.

"Gah!"

　The fishman flew backward with a pained expression on his face and landed on his feet. I must have hit him pretty hard, but he still had not lost his will to fight. It is still sturdy after all. He is definitely stronger than Suda.

「Isn't that fishman strong?」  
「Who the hell is he to be able to exchange blows with Shachiken?」   
「He's too strong.」   
「He's good, fishman.」   
「I'm in a trend of praising monsters.」   
「It can't be helped, there have been very few monsters that can fight properly.」   
「They're usually cut in half before you know it.」    
「I mean, is that really a fishman?　It's definitely not a normal monster.」

　As some of the comments have said, that is no ordinary fishman.    
　I have fought fishmen before, but they were not that strong. Fishmen are A-rank monsters, but the one in front of me is stronger than an S-rank monster.

"......I'll try using that one."

　I muttered quietly and took out a machine from my pocket.   
　The name of this machine is "Labyrinth Analyzer". It is shaped like a speed gun that measures speed. It reads the shape, form, and elemental information of an object and pulls the object's data from a database.
　With this machine, even undiscovered monsters can be viewed if they have information from the labyrinth information terminal archives. It is worth a try.

　Only government officials possess labyrinth analyzers, but I was able to ask Mr. Dojima to give me one. I'll have to thank him again later.

"Let the analysis begin,"

　I activate the labyrinth analyzer toward the fishman who is watching us from afar.   
　The analysis is completed immediately, and the opponent's information is projected in the air.

Deep One Rank: EX I      
A monster similar to a fishman.   
They serve an evil god and sometimes work in packs.    
It uses its sharp fins, teeth, and strong body to fight.    
Government Note: No cases found.    

"Deep...... one?"

　I nod my head at the unfamiliar name.    
　From what is written at the end, it seems it was still an undiscovered monster.

「I knew Deep One was a Cthulhu deity!」   
「Seriously, it's a monster I've never heard of.」   
「Well, I guess we can assume it's a kind of fishman.」   
「I didn't know there were other Cthulhu monsters besides the Shoggoths.」   
「I'll have to check my SAN: ......!」   
「I don't know anything about the Deep One.」   
「Well, most people don't know about it. Only a fanatic like me knows about it (clicks glasses).」   
「You look so smug.」

　From the comments, this guy seems to be a monster in the same family as the shoggoths.   
　No wonder my head hurts a little when I see it on the street. I'll have to watch out for its ability to pollute the mind, even if it's resistant.

「I mean, what's EX I?　Isn't rank EX unmeasurable and not classified beyond that?」   
「Ah, I heard that since Shachiken defeated them, EX ranks need to be classified as well.」   
「I heard that Shogoth was also reclassified as EX I.」   
「Does that mean this fishman is the weakest of the EX ranks?」   
「That's true, but you can't be too careful because all of the EX ranks are catastrophic to the capital.」    
「Some of the cities were destroyed by Shogos.」   

　As the commenter said, the EX ranks are now divided into five levels.   
　EX I is the weakest, then II, III, IV, V, and stronger. The classification is information that is not available in the labyrinth information terminal archives, so the government calculates and ranks the monsters based on their own magical elements.

　Well, anyway, the opponent is the weakest of the EX ranks, but it means that you cannot let your guard down.    
　There is a high possibility that this is the reason this dungeon is active. It would be better to defeat him here for sure.
