Tl: Sam


…



"guu......"   
"......"

　Me and the fishman glared at each other and measure our timing.   
　Slowly breathing, we rushed out at ...... the same time, keeping a watchful eye on the other's actions.

"Guh!"

　The fishman opened his arms and grabbed at me.   
　His hands were covered with sharp claws. The claws were much sharper than those of a knife. It would have been painful if it had pierced me.   
<!--more-->
　I blocked him by grabbing both of his wrists. Then..,

"Gah!"

　The fishman ripped out his fangs and tried to bite me on the neck.   
　His fangs, like his claws, are so sharp that they could bite through the flesh of an S-rank monster.

　Of course, you don't have to eat them. I quickly shot a "kick" straight up and hit the fishman right in the jaw from below.

「Too fast, lmao.」   
「I seriously don't know what's going on here.」    
「So this is Yamcha's perspective.......」   
「We can't keep up with the battle ahead.」    
「I've been following you since the beginning.」    
「Deep One, you're doing great.」(Tl: Leave it to this guy's live chat to always cheer for the monster)   
「How can he be so strong when he's not using a sword?」   
「A, because he's Shachiken.」   
「I understand.」

　The fishman stumbled on the spot, having been struck through the jaw. Apparently, he had a brain in his head properly. His body seems to be similar to a human's.   
　I grabbed the fishman's arm and spun him around on the spot, using myself as a fulcrum. Then, after gaining enough momentum, I throw the fishman toward the underground lake.   

"Gah!"

　The fishman spun around and bounced on the surface of the water like a stone.(Tl: Why skip stones when you can skip OP fishmen?)    
　I immediately ran after him. And when I caught up to the fishman on the water, I kicked its body up into the air.   

「I'm so messed up.」   
「I'm surprised you're still alive, Fishman-kun.......」   
「Seriously, the scale of the battle is Z Warrior.」   
「There's no wonder they're a fighting race.」    
「I think they're about to start shooting air bombs.」    
「Why isn't anyone talking about the fact that they're already running on the water?」   
「Well, they can do double jumps, so they should be able to do that.」(Tl: I mean bro jumped on air and you're stuck on the fact he's running on water?)    
「I feel numb lol.」

　I kicked the surface of the water and jumped to catch up with the fishman above me, and then, to top it all off, I kicked him.   
　Zugon!　The fishman slammed into the ground with such force that he fell limply to the ground.

"Fuh..."

　I also landed on the ground and approached the fishman.   
　The fishman was not going to be able to move for a while if I attacked him this much. I thought so, but the fishman did not give up and attacked me.

"Gohh!”

　It showed a great fighting spirit to still be coming at me.   
　I respectfully punched him in the face as hard as I could.

"Hibu-hibu?"

　The fishman staggered as he was knocked off his feet.   
　Taking advantage of the opportunity, I hit the fishman in the face again and again.

「You're so merciless!」   
「I'm starting to feel sorry for him.」   
「Fishman-kun, your face is beat up.」    
「Oh my God, .......」    
「I heard there's a company president who used to work with this guy like a slave.」    
「There's no such person ...... is there?」    
「He's a real daredevil, isn't he? I'm amazed.」   
「Suda's re-evaluation lol.」

　I hit the fishman for a while, but he never showed any sign of collapsing.    
　As expected of an EX rank, its sturdiness is unmatched by an S rank monster.

　I had no choice but to use my sword to finish him off.    
　As soon as I put my hand on the sword at my waist, something unexpected happens.

"Oh, no!　Stop it already!　I give up, I give up!　Spare my life!"    
"What ............?"


  <div data-nat="424166"></div>


　Suddenly, the fishman started begging for ・・・・ his life in Japanese.   
　I've never heard of a monster speaking a language. Even I, with my long experience in dungeons, froze in my thoughts.

「What?」   
「What?」   
「Seriously?」   
「It's talking lol.」   
「Shaabettahhhh!」   
「Can monsters talk?」   
「Of course not!」   
「I know of bird monsters that imitate human voices, but I don't think any of them can speak with a will.」   
「Why is it that Shachiken's delivery is always so chaotic?」   
「I seriously got goosebumps.」   

　The comments section was also in an uproar.   
　The number of viewers is growing rapidly. Monsters talking is unprecedented. The whole world is probably paying attention.

　Anyway, such an opportunity doesn't come along very often. Let's talk carefully.

"You can talk?"   
"I was just startled and attacked you, but I didn't mean to hurt you!　So please spare my life ......?　You understand my language?"

　For some reason, the fishman was also surprised and rolled his eyes.   
　Apparently, he didn't think they could understand him either.

　I don't consider anyone who can communicate with me a monster. I took my hand off my sword and put it out of battle mode.    
　Now, what should I do? I don't know what to do because I have never communicated with a monster except for killing each other.

　The other side is also fidgeting, as if it doesn't know what to do. When we were fighting, he looked terrifying, but now he's starting to look like a human being.

　I'm going to ...... ask them to relax for a while so that I can listen to what they have to say. Then there is only one thing to do.   
　I switch to business mode of honorifics and make a suggestion to the fishman.

"Well,......, for the time being, why don't we have some food?"



......
