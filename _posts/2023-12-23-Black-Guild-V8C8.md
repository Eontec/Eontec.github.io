Tl: Sam


…



"Here you go. Feel free to eat."

　I put the monster dish in front of the fishman and said so.   
　The fishman's eyes light up, "itadakimasu" and began to eat the food.

"Mogu mogu ...... Yum!　I've never had such delicious umeemon!　I can't get enough of it!"

　The fishman ate with a single-minded devotion.   
I made Venom Serpent steak and Venom Serpent soup. It's a full course of fried Venom Serpent and snake dishes.   
<!--more-->
　Seeing that he ate the monster's meat without any problem, it seems that he has enough tolerance for magical elements.

"I'm surprised that you not only let me go, but also gave me such a delicious meal!　I won't forget this favor, I promise!""

　The mysterious fishman said pleasantly as he gobbled up my Venom Serpent dish. We seem to have established a friendly relationship for the time being, and I'm sure we could talk about a lot of things.

「You're a good eater, aren't you?」   
「You're eating just fine.」   
「I'm jealous that you get to eat Shachiken's food.」   
「How come you're so familiar with him?」   
「Tanaka is the only one who can get him to eat」   
「You've got to get his stomach first.」(TL: Basically, the road to a man's heart)   
「Are you going to marry this guy? lol」
「I really feel like I'm watching a historical moment.」   
「 Shachiken's negotiating skills will be put to the test.」

　After enjoying his meal for a while, the fishman was satisfied and stopped eating, saying, "Fu, I'm full."   
　It's time to ask him some questions.

"Did the ...... meal suit your palate?"   
"Yes, of course!　I haven't had such a delicious meal even in my hometown. Well, it's a good thing to be in distress!"   
"Local, huh? May I ask something about you?"   
"Of course, of course!　Ask me anything, Tanaka Aniki!"   
"Tanaka...... Aniki?"(Tl: Basically nii-san, but for thugs- I mean, more respectful)   

　 I tilted my head at that word, which I was not used to hearing so often.   
　I don't remember having a brother who was this fishy.

「lmao.」   
「Shachiken, you're so confused, lol.」   
「You've been missed, haven't you?」   
「I don't think anyone but Shachiken would have a Deep One as a brother.」   
「I don't know anyone who would take a monster as a protege.」   
「I want to be Tanaka's apprentice, too.」   
「I want to be his mistress, too.」   
「The flow has changed.」    
「I want to be a fishman so I can be Shachiken's brother ...... I got an idea」   
「I'm calling it in.」   

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

"I fell in love with my brother's strength like an evil god and his heart as deep as the abyss!　Please stop using honorifics and call me Dagosuke!"(Tl: I found no good translation for the wordダゴ助)   
"...... haa."

　I don't know, but it seems he liked me more than I imagined.   
　Well, if you want me to call you that, there's no reason for me to refuse. I broke out of the honorific mode and started asking questions.

"So, ...... Dagosuke, was it?　Where are you from?"(Tl: It;s his name, i feel so stupid, but oh well)   
"Heh, I was in a pond near my house. I was fishing there when I saw a suspicious figure. I approached him and suddenly I was transported into this dungeon."   
"Where is this house?"   
"I don't know how to answer that question. It is in the lower part of the place where many people like me live."

　As far as I can tell, this guy was not born in a dungeon, but was brought in from another place. And in that place, a race similar to this one, what we call "monsters," live.   
　There are two possible hypotheses.   
　The first is that somewhere on earth there is a place where a race similar to this one lives. Humans have explored almost all of the earth's surface, but it would not be surprising if we have not found them living, for example, in the deep sea.

　The second is that they are from some other world ...... that is different from the earth, or in other words, another world. Another world seems like a ridiculous story, but it is possible since Maki-san said something similar at the Magic Research Bureau.   
　Which hypothesis is correct will determine the measures we will take in the future. We need to find out for sure.

　While I was thinking about this, Dagosuke began to talk to me.

"I didn't think there were strong people like you among human beings. I was told growing up that humans are fragile creatures."   
"Are you related to humans?"   
"No, not much. No, we have very little contact with humans. Especially, many of them are from the Kingdom of Lustria. They live close to where we live."   
"...... wait a minute."

　Suddenly, I heard unfamiliar words.   
　I stop the conversation and dig deeper.

"Dagosuuke, can you tell me the names of all the countries you know?"   
"There's the Kingdom of Lustria, the Orcian Empire ......, and the Holy Tree Kingdom of Orswood!　I don't know much about the human world, so that's about it."

　The first is the "Lustria Kingdom," the second is the "Orsian Empire," and the third is the "Holy Tree Kingdom of Orswood"   
　There is no doubt about it. ...... This guy is from a different world from here on earth.

Tl Note: Isekai Route has been compplete. If I wasn't so tired, I'd have done the next 2 chapters.
