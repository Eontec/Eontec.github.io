"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!　This is a different world from the one I was in?"

　Dagosuke's eyes popped out in surprise when he heard what I had to say.    
　He is a fishman who exaggerates his reactions at every turn.

　But I guess it is natural to be surprised if you suddenly find yourself in a different world. The comments were flowing so fast that I couldn't follow them with my eyes.

「Another world, really?」    
「You've been transported to another world!」   
「Seriously, I'm going to get hit by a truck!」   
<!--more-->
「Oh my God, is this really information that should be broadcast?」   
「Social networking sites and message boards are going crazy over this!」   
「I had no idea where the dungeon and monsters came from until now.」   
「I'm glad I watched this stream live  ......」   
「I'm so glad I was there to witness this historic moment.」   
「I wish I could go to another world in my life. ......」   
「Fishman Reincarnation ～ I thought I was transported to a dungeon, but it turned out to be another world. I was attacked by a strong swordsman, but he saved my life, so I'm going to become his apprentice.」    
「It's decided to make it into a novel.」   
「Dagosuke-kun is the hero!」    
「There's a chance he'll become a heroine from here......」   
「I don't want a heroine like this.......」

　I can't follow the excitement with my eyes. I'm sure the social networking sites are also in trouble.    
The governments of various countries are probably in a panic after getting this information. I'm sure Dojima-san is also busy dealing with the situation.

　I had a hunch, to be honest.......    
　I had a hunch that Dagosuke might be from another world.

　There was an option to cut off the distribution and keep the information secret, but I chose not to do that because I felt that this problem should be shared with the whole world.   
　If I kept the information secret, Dagosuke would be targeted by the rest of the world.   
　Well, even at this stage, other countries will want Dagosuke, but if I make his information open, the number of people who will try to mess with him will decrease to some extent.

　To ensure his safety, we need to make him spit out all the information he has and release it to the public. Information is a weapon, but because of its value, it can sometimes hurt you.

"I'm not going back to my old world!　Can't I go back to my old world now?"

　Dagosuke asks me, half crying.   
　Dagosuke may look scary, but he has a timid personality. I guess his mind can't catch up with the suddenness of the situation.

"...... honestly, I don't know. I wish I knew how to get across the world, but I don't have a clue."   
"Sho, shon naa. Ohhh ...... am I all alone here ......?" 

　Dagosuke nodded his head, his shoulders slumped.   
　 I took pity on him and put my hand on his shoulder.

"I don't know how to get you back, but I'll take care of you while you're in this world. We met here because of some kind of connection. So... cheer up."    
"Oh, Aniki ......!"

　Dagosuuke's eyes got moist and he suddenly hugged me.

"Uwaaaaa! 　I was quite moved!　I'll follow you for the rest of my life!"   
"Stop it!　Your scales hurt and you smell like seaweed!"   

「He totally loves you!」   
「You've already conquered him.」     
「That's what I'm talking about. ......」    
「I want to be seduced by Tanaka too!」    
「I'm so excited.」    
「Dagosuuke!　Take your place!」   
「Tanaka's heroine race board is going to be so much fun.」    
「I didn't know there was such a board.......」    

　I pull away from Dagosuke, who is clinging to me, and move away.   
　It was difficult because he was EX rank and his strength was unnecessarily strong. I'm going to hit him next time he does it.

"Huh, then I guess I'll just go outside for once. That's fine, right?"

　　The dungeon's strange behavior was probably caused by Dagosuke. I couldn't go down to the lowest level, but my first priority was to protect him.   
　If we went down there and Dagosuke died, we would be in serious trouble. I'm concerned about going further down, but the most important thing is to get him back to the surface safely.

"Well, I'm fine with that. ...... is that okay with you?"    
"Hmm?　What?"

　When I asked him that, he said something I had never imagined.

"At the bottom of this dungeon, there's a bad guy, isn't there? There is a monster at the bottom of this dungeon, much stronger than me. Isn't that what you came here to defeat?"
