"Ooraaaaa!　Get out of my way!"

　Dagosuke, a new member of the group, rushed ahead at breakneck speed while shouting loudly.   
Dagosuke beats down the attacking monsters one after another.   
　Dagosuke may be a bit of a pushover, but he is an EX rank. In other words, his fighting ability is higher than that of S-rank monsters and explorers. He will be a reliable partner in the battles to come.

"Oh no!　I'm trapped!　Help me, brother!"

　Let's correct ....... He may be useless after all.   
　I ran up to Dagosuuke and cut the chains that were wrapped around his body. I can't believe he fell for such a classic trap.

「Dagosuke, you're so funny!」    
「I remember one of you in my class who was such a goody-two-shoes.」   
「He's supposed to be strong, but he's not at all reliable. 」   
「Is he going to be okay like this?」    
「Well, you have Shachiken, so I'm sure you'll be fine.」     

"I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not used to dungeons."   
"Well, that's okay, but ...... are there few dungeons in your world?"   
"There seem to be a lot of dungeons where humans live. But there are very few where we live."   

　I guess there are dungeons, after all.    
　That means that dungeons came from another world, in all probability.   

　But for what purpose?　I don't understand the purpose at all.   
　I wonder if this is not man-made, but a natural accident.   

"Riri?"

　While I was racking my brains, Riri appeared from her breast pocket.   
　I haven't seen her for a while. It seems that she has been sleeping until now.

"Oh, by the way, is 『 Shoggoth 』 one of Dagosuke's friends?"   
"Yes, they are. They are also a member of the race that serves the evil gods. ......?"

　When Dagosuke saw Riri, his eyeballs popped out and he was surprised.      
　It was still a good reaction. If she were to become a stand-up comedian, she would be in great demand.

"What's going on?"
"Ahh Brother!　Why is Riri here?"   
"...... Wait a minute. How do you know Riri's name?"

　Those of us on this side of the world know the name Riri the Shoggoth.    
　Riri has an explosive popularity on the Internet, with tens of thousands of likes in an instant just for posting a new photo on social media. The last photo she posted of herself napping had 100 million likes. It's a bit much, no matter how many international fans she has.

　But Dago is different.    
　He was in a different world before he met me here. There was no way he could have known about Riri. What the hell is going on?

"Riri has become the idol of our boss, the evil god. So, we, his minions, are forced to make Riri's goods."    
"...... So how does the evil god know about Riri?"   
"The evil gods can use various kinds of power. I think they are using those powers to watch my brother's activities."

「Seriously, Evil God-kun is watching the distribution too?」   
「Yes, he's one of us. You're one of us!」   
「Yes, yes!　Are you watching, Evil God-kun?」   
「Riri's cuteness is the same all over the world (......) or even in all dimensions.」   
「I couldn't help but imagine Cthulhu cheering for Riri in front of the monitor. It's too funny.」   
「I can't wait for you to make Riri goods.」     
「That's as expected of our Riri!」   
「Fumuguru Fumuguruii!  (character string difficult to describe)」    
「Could these unintelligible characters be ......, no way!」    
「Riritaso, iaiaia.」(Tl: No wayyy, nooo wayyy Who would have thought[no profanity])

　...... I didn't think there were evil gods among the viewers.    
　And I didn't think Riri was even popular with those people.

"Good for you, I heard you're popular."   
"Riri?"

　Riri tilted her head as if she didn't understand what was going on.    
　It feels a little unpleasant to be observed by an evil god, but I don't think they can do anything to me either. Let's do it without worrying.    

"I'm going to do it without worrying about it. The next guy is here."   
"Yeah, I know."

　A black skeleton with a sword in its hand is coming this way with a clattering sound.   
　It is the highest level of skeletons, the 『 elite black bone soldier ・  black skeleton 』.

「Seriously, that's the elite Black Skeleton!」   
「It's just a black skeleton, is it strong?」   
「It sure looks weak!」   
「Too many idiots. That's a rank S monster.」   
「I guess the monsters in the deeper levels are getting a little too strong.」    
「It looks like just a black skeleton, but it's that strong.」   
「Skeletons can be dismembered a bit, but they can still revive.」   
「I wonder if magic and weapons with holy attributes can easily defeat them?　I wonder if Shachiken has them too?」   
「Weapons with the holy attribute are precious, but Shachiken might have them.」   
「I mean, if he doesn't have it, it's going to be pretty tough to defeat the elite Black Bone Soldier Black Skeleton.」

『Gah gah! 』

　Black Skeleton, the elite Black Bone Soldier, attacked us with a rasping voice.   
　If I had a weapon with the holy attribute, I could purify it in one shot, but unfortunately, I don't have such a weapon. So, I'm going to use a little rough but forceful hand.

"Yo.... tsu"

　The elite Black Bone Soldier ・Black Skeleton, ducks a blow from his sword and punches him in the gut. The impact of the punch disintegrates the body of the elite black skeleton.   
　The skeleton is resistant to slashing. Since its weakness is blows, it can only be hit with its fists.

「It disintegrates into pieces with a single blow lol.」   
「Are Shachiken's fists made of steel?」   
「The elite black bone soldier Black Skeleton is pretty hard. ......」    
「I thought Shachiken's fists were made of diamonds.」    
「Tanaka's fists are unbreakable.」

　The elite Black Bone Soldier Black Skeleton in pieces.   
　But their body began to gather in one place again. This is the tricky thing about skeletons. Even if they fall apart, they soon stick together and regenerate.    
　That's why you have to crush them carefully.

"Eeeeeeeeee!"

　Step on the bones that are close to you and crush them until they are shattered.    
　After that, another bone. When that is done, another bone, and then another. Crushing bones until they could no longer be regenerated.

「Eeeeee!」   
「Too scary!」    
「Skeleton's face is turning more and more hopeless. ......」    
「That's because even if he tries to regenerate, he's being crushed from one side to the other. I'm scared.」   
「How can he crush bones harder than steel so easily?」    
「It's Shachiken .......」    
「Scarier than skeletons.」    

　After shattering a few bones, the elite black bone soldier ・ Black Skeleton seems to have given up on regeneration and disappears into dust. Phew, he was a troublesome opponent.   
　As I was about to move on, I noticed that Dagosuke was staring at me.

"Nn?　What's wrong?"   
"No......, I just thought that I mustn't offend my brother."

「Agreed.」   
「I can only understand.」   
「I know. - That's right.」   
「I feel sorry for the monsters who have to fight with Shachiken.」   
「When Tanaka becomes the enemy, it'll be the end of the earth.」   

　For some reason, comments began to flow in agreeing with Dagosuke's opinion.    
　I'm just trying my best to defeat the monsters.

"Look, let's get on with it. It's almost past the hour."    
"Oh, wait a minute, brother!"

　We continued deeper and deeper into the dungeon.    
　The concentration of magical elements was increasing. We were probably close to reaching the bottom.
