"Ze, ze, I'm getting tired of the quicksand......."

　Dagosuke whined after we had been down in the dungeon for a while.   
　We were certainly moving all the time. We had no time to rest because monsters were constantly attacking us.    
I had no idea that the dungeon was this deep. We realized that we had less than 30 minutes until 18:00. No matter how fast I hurry, it seems that I will never be able to finish my work on time.   
　Remembering my days as an office worker, I feel a little depressed.

"...Still, the atmosphere of the dungeon has changed quite a bit. The upper part had a somewhat sacred feel to it." 

　The deeper you go into the dungeon here, the worse the air gets.   
　It is not simply because of the thickening of the magical element. The air here is becoming thicker and thicker with the smell of death, or perhaps it would be easier to understand if I said it was the smell of death.    
　As if to confirm this, the monsters are all undead monsters such as skeletons.     
　The roots of the world tree are also black and rotten in many parts.

"It certainly gives off a bad vibe. But what does this bother you?"   
"The appearance of the dungeon is closely related to the boss. I used to think that because it was a huge wooden dungeon, a wooden monster would be the boss, but it's not so easy to guess anymore."

　For example, if the dungeon has many water areas, the boss is most likely an aquatic monster. There are exceptions to everything, but I would say there are very few dungeons that deviate from this rule.

　I had assumed that since this dungeon was mostly made of "wood," the bosses would be the same, but the deeper I went...... the stronger my feeling became that this was not the case.   
　There's something about the boss that makes me think there will be a more evil boss. 

「It sure has a nasty vibe (for some reason I can't convert it)."   
「Is it an undead boss after all?」   
「Maybe a general skeleton or an undead dragon?　If it's a skeleton king or something like that, I'm going to have a hard time.」   
「I don't think I'll have a hard time with those. It's Shachiken, remember?」   
「Sure, lol.」    
「But why did the dungeon change in the middle, is there anything else like it?」   
「I watch the dungeon delivery every day and I've never seen anything else like it.」   
「I wonder why. Maybe there are two bosses or something.」   
「Haha, that can't be right, there's no way...... right?」   
「At least there is no precedent. Well, Shachiken himself is a master of running into unprecedented situations.」   
「lol.」

　......Honestly, I thought about what you're talking about in the comments right now.   
　This dungeon changed its aspect in the first half and the second half, just before and after we met Dagosuke. I've been in countless dungeons and I've never seen one like this before.

　So I don't know why the dungeon changed.    
　The most likely explanation is that there are two bosses, which is mentioned in the comments. This is easy to explain. The dungeon was affected by both bosses, and that's why it's such a distorted dungeon.

　But it is too early to assume that. Let's prepare ourselves to deal with whatever happens.

"Oh, it looks like the end is down here, brother."

　Dagosuke said, peering into the big hole in front of him.   
　I said, "All right, let's go," and then jumped down from the root and headed down.

"Whoa, wait a minute, bro!"

「Still no hesitation, lol.」   
「Go on, Shachiken!」   
「Why is Deep One more hesitant than me? ......」   
「A, because he's Shachiken.」   
「Dagosuke, you're doing great.」   
「Tanaka!　Good luck!」   

　After falling for a while, I finally landed at the bottom of the World Tree dungeon.

"Yo, tsu!"   
"Gyaaaaah!　Bube!"

　Behind me, Dagosuke failed to land and hit the ground hard.   
　He looks like he's in pain, but after a little while he gets up. This guy is pretty sturdy, too. It seems to be all right even if I leave him alone.

"It's a pretty big space, isn't it?"   
"Yes, it is."

　It was an open space.   
　The roots and ground were stained black, and the air was filled with thick magic element.

　The air is filled with a thick layer of magic element.

"...... nothing is happening."   
"Oh, I've never seen anything like this before."   
"I've never seen anything like this before. But if the monsters don't show up, I guess I'll have to check ...... that."   
"I guess so. ......"   

　We then turned our eyes to the center of the lowest level.    
　There, a "ball of light" was sitting. The diameter is about 20 meters, or so, and it is quite large.   
　The sphere, which exists as if covering the tip of the huge root in the center, was clearly an anomaly that set it apart from other places.


  <div data-nat="424166"></div>


"What is this?"   
"Well, it looks a lot like warding magic. I've never seen this kind of thing before."

　We approached the sphere and observed it closely.    
　On the surface of the shining sphere, there are many patterns and letters floating on the surface. Unfortunately, we don't know what they mean.

I thought to myself, "I guess I'll just have to keep looking at ......."

　I decide to touch the sphere.    
　My hand slips through the sphere and goes to the back of it.

"Ah, brother!　Are you all right?"   
"I'm fine. It's just a little warm. No pain." 

　I try to put my hand in and out, but I don't see anything unusual. I don't know if the warding is not working or if they don't consider me an enemy. I don't know, but I don't think I'll have any trouble finding out what's going on inside.

"Then I'm going to go inside ...... and see what's going on."

　Dagosuke's hand touched the ball of light, and he was blown away, rolling on the ground.    
　The hand that touched it is bright red and swollen. It looks painful.

"Why can't I touch it?"
"It seems that the master of this ward doesn't get along with you."   
"Ugh, it's terrible to have a harmless deep one like me."   

　Dagosuke looks sad.   
　It is easy to forget because of his comical behavior, but he is a subordinate of the Evil God. Many will see him as an enemy.

"I'll go check on him. Dagosuke, please be quiet."    
"I understand. Please be careful, brother.

　I nodded at his words and entered the sphere of light.    
　Unlike the outside, the inside of the sphere was full of greenery. The roots are not rotten, and the air is filled with a clearness similar to that of the upper reaches of the World Tree. It seems that no bad air from the outside is coming in here.

"That is ......"

　The center of this space.   
　There is something at the tip of the root of the World Tree.

　I slowly approach it with my hand on my sword.    
　The tip of the root was like a bed. A natural bed made of tree roots and leaves. Someone is sleeping on it.

　It was a person, breathing a lovely sleep.   
　A very beautiful looking blonde woman. She was sleeping comfortably with her body curled up. There is a glittering sword on her chest, and she is sleeping as if holding it.

「Eh, who is she?」    
「She's so beautiful.」   
「Is she really human?」   
「She has too big breasts.」    
「Her face is so well-defined that it's almost scary.」    
「At least she's not Japanese, right?」   
「No gaijin has such a beautiful face.」    
「......?　What's wrong with her ears?」    

　As I slowly approach the wooden bed, I notice something.    
　The woman's ears were ...... obviously long and pointed. I knew of a species with these features.

"Nn, nn......."

　The woman slowly wakes up, her voice leaking out.   
　She stretches and rose up, and when she noticed my presence, she exclaims in surprise, "He, who?". I'm the one who wants to ask who.

"Why is a human being here?　I mean, where am I?"   
"I'm not sure. I'll tell you once you talk to me......."

　I approached her to calm her down, but she pulled out a golden sword she was holding and pointed it at me. I'm not calm.

"Would you lower your sword?"    
"Oh, shut up!　Who do you think you are?"    
"No, I don't know, but ......"

　I replied, thinking it was going to be a hassle.   
　Then she said, "You don't know who I am?" She was surprised, and then told me her identity.

"I am one of the proud High Elves and Princess of Orswood in the Land of the Holy Tree. I am Lilicia Orpheun Olswood!　Do not say that you do not know this name!"

　Yes, this woman who called herself Lilicia had the same appearance as the "elves" that often appear in fantasy works.   
　What a surprise...a talking fishman, then an elf. Why in the world do these bad things keep appearing in front of me?
