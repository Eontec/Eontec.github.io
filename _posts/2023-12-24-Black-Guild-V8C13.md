「Holy Elf ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！ !」    
「If there are fishmen, there are elves. Of course (glasses quick).」   
「She's my type, she's too beautiful.」    
「First person straw is too good for me, I like it (straight face).」   
「Lilicia-tan ha ha ha ha!」   
「There's a certain kukkoro feel to her.」   
「A princess knight?」   
「I think she might be a princess elf.」   
「This elf's attitude and breasts are too big.」  
<!--more--> 
「Holy shit, tits! Tits!」    
「Her tits are too big. ......」   
「Oh, my God, this is Erofu, isn't it?」   
「But what are you going to do now?　Are you going to defeat the elves?」   
「Is this elf the boss in the first place?」

　The commenters who saw the elf were in an uproar.   
　I understand that feeling. If I had been a viewer, I would have been excited too. Boys love elves no matter how old they are.

　But when you're in charge, you can't get carried away.    
　This elf is a super important reference person to know about the other world. Dagosuke seems to be from another world, but he has one foot in the monster world.    
This elf is probably more knowledgeable about the other world. I'll have to get to know her better first in order to ask her a lot of questions.

"It's ...... a bit daunting."

　It's too much responsibility for a company animal to take on. The Japanese government will be bashed by the world if they fail to protect the elves. Just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach.   
　It was supposed to be a simple job of investigating the dungeon. This is not worth it unless I can get Mr. Dojima to pay me an allowance.

"What are you messing around with?　Who are you?　I was supposed to be fighting that hateful avenger ...... Answer me!"

　The elf says with a great fury.    
　It seems that she, like Dagosuke, was brought here suddenly. The actual "hateful revenge" is a concern, but the first step is to break the hostility.

"Uh, ......, my name is Makoto Tanaka. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

　Company livestock mode is on.    
　I greeted her and gave her my business card in a fluid motion.   
　The elf, who introduced herself as Lilicia, was wary of me, but took my card as if snatching it with the hand that was not holding a sword. It seems she wants the same information as I do.

"He gave his business card to the elf."   
"You're a corporate employee, aren't you?"   
"I guess business etiquette is understood even in other worlds."   
"I really can't take my eyes off this. How is this going to end?"   
"Lilicia-tan, ha ha ha."

"White Wolf White Wolf Guild President, Makoto Tanaka ......?　Are you the master of the guild?"   
"Yes. Something like that."   
"I see, you seem to be able to talk a little."

　 Her eyes were still steely, but I felt her wariness had eased a little.
　My experience as a company employee has come in handy.

　There is one thing I learned from this exchange. I learned one thing from this exchange: the other person can also read.    
　My business card is written in Japanese, of course. The elf was able to read it without any difficulty. In other words, the other party can read Japanese or has some kind of technology that allows them to read unknown characters.

　I'm not sure if it's ......, or if it's ・・・・・・・ that they have.   
　Even Dagosuke was able to speak Japanese from the beginning, even though he did not do anything. It is not possible that the language used by the evil gods and the Japanese language happen to be the same.    
　It makes the most sense to think that intelligent creatures from another world have their language automatically translated ・・・・. And that translation extends to the written word?    
　Well, this is all just a hypothesis, but it seems highly possible.

"What are you not telling me, Tanaka?　If you know something, tell me everything!　Tell us where we are and why you are here!"   
"I'm sorry. I was just thinking. Uh, it's a bit of a long story, if you don't mind."    
"...... is fine. Tell me about it." 

　She seemed to be willing to listen to me, even though she still had the tip of the sword pointed at her.
　Whether she believed me or not, I would tell her the whole story if she would listen to me.
