…


　I know that this world is different from the one Lilicia was in. That this is the lowest level of a dungeon. I told her as politely as I could that I was in the business of distributing dungeons, that I had attacked this dungeon on business and had arrived here by chance, and that I was willing to protect you. I told her as politely as I could that I was willing to protect her and that I wanted her to follow me.

　Lilicia listened to me in silence until I finished.    
　After listening to everything I had to say, Lilicia opened her mouth and said, "I see, it's a different world.
<!--more-->

"I see, it's a different world. It is true that the mana here is different from where I was. If the reason is that it is a different world, that makes sense."   
"Then ......"    
"But..."

　
　Lilicia readjusts her sword and turns her hostile gaze on me.　I have a bad feeling about this.

"It's not a reason to believe you. Another world?　Dungeon delivery?　If you are going to deceive me, you'd better come up with a better lie. I would never believe such a ridiculous story"

　The business deal failed.   
　I slumped my shoulders in disappointment. Well, maybe it's more absurd to expect me to believe it, but it's the truth, so there's nothing I can do.

"Who is your master?　Is it the neighboring countries who don't like me, ...... or is it the Demon King?　The aim is either my person or this treasured sword........ Either way, I will not fall into the hands of evil like you in a place like this."

　The golden sword in Lilicia's hand begins to glow.   
　It seems to be a sword with some kind of special ability.     
　I don't want to be silently cut down either, but if I hurt the other person, it will be impossible to repair our relationship.......Hey?　Isn't this a dead end?

「Oh no.」   
「It's already impossible, isn't it?」    
「This is the type of enemy that can no longer be made friendly once you've antagonized it.」    
「Lilicia-tan, hahaha!」   
「What are we going to do?」   
「Tanaka!　I mean, do something about that ......!」   
「Losing the elves would be a global loss. I mean, in a moe sense.」    
「Please make me a distributor somehow!」    
「You can be an elf distributor or .......」    
「I don't think this is the time for this.」    

"Bow down before the power of my treasured sword!"

　Lilicia leaped high and came at me with all her might.    
　I thought for a moment about pulling out my sword, but I didn't want to injure her. I put my right arm out in front of me in a defensive posture.

"You've lost your mind!　You should know the power of the elves!"

　The golden sword swung vigorously and struck my right arm with a ...... crack!　The sword was broken cleanly from the center with a metallic sound.

"What?"    
"Ah!"

　The top half of the treasure sword fell and pierced the ground.    
　Silence fell. Oh, no, this is awkward.

　I defended myself unintentionally, but if this was going to happen, I should have taken the white blade.

「No, lol.」   
「Why is he winning against the treasure sword (dumbfounded)?」   
「It's too hard.」   
「What are you doing?」    
「He defended himself with...... his body?」    
「It's true, and it bothers me.」    
「Lilicia, you look so stunned.」    
「I'm sure that's true, since her precious sword was broken just by hitting his arm.」   
「It was the wrong person. ......」    
「There are nutrients you can only get from the face of a despairing elf princess.」    
「Lilicia-tan hahaha.」    
「The air is too awkward.」

　Lilicia was stunned for a moment, then flops down and sits there.    
　Then, as if tears were in her big eyes,...... she suddenly starts to cry.

"Ugh,...... my treasured sword is broken,...... it's so precious to me! Mother will scold me!"

　The elven princess was sobbing like that.    
　What in the world should I do? I was so puzzled that I went up to Lilicia to comfort her.
