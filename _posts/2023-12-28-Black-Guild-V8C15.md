"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you."


　The elf, Lilicia, was still crying, although I tried desperately to quiet her down.   
　I'm in trouble, what should I do ......?

「Waa......a......」   
「She cried!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!」   
「Sensei, Tanaka-kun made me cry.」   
「Shachiken is so confused, what's wrong with her?」   
「This elf has so many moe attributes.」   
「Her crying face is so cute.」   
「You're responsible for this.」    
「I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it!」    
「Well, there are some problems on the side of the sword that can be easily broken.」    
<!--more-->
「No, it's Shachiken's fault. His body is hard enough to shatter the scales of a sapphire dragon.」   
「I miss Scale-kun.」   
「How are you doing, Scale-kun?」   
「Scale-kun is sleeping next to me.」   
「I'm jealous of Scale's popularity as usual.」

　The comments section is as usual filled with words of any kind.     
　Damn. I'm not good at things that can't be solved with physical means. What the hell should I do? I twisted my head around and came up with an idea. 

"Yes, I know a good blacksmith. I know a good blacksmith. I'm sure that person can fix that sword."   
"Oh, geez, ......, really?"    
"Yes, yes. I promise."    
"...... understand. I'll believe you"

　Lilicia stopped crying while sniffling.    
　Hey, that helped.    
　I'm sorry, but I'll ask Kaoru-san to do her best. She fixed my sword the last time I broke it, and I'm sure she'll fix it beautifully this time too...maybe.

"......I'm sorry for my distraction, I apologize. Let me introduce myself again. I am Lilithia Orpheun Olswood, Princess of Olswood in the Land of the Holy Tree. Nice to meet you, Tanaka."    
"Yes, it's nice to meet you too, Lilicia."

　Lilicia-san became friendly, as if she had cooled down after having her sword broken.   
　I was glad.

"I'm glad to hear that.　For the time being, as for me, I would like you to come to the ground with me. This is being broadcasted, so I think we will be ready to receive Lilicia-san by the time we leave."

　Mr. Dojima and Amatsuki would have done a good job of handling the tedious procedures there.   
　It must be a lot of work to welcome two people from another world at once, but that's the government's job. I'm just the president of a small guild, so it's not something I need to worry about.

"But you still don't believe me, do you? What should I do?"    
"I still don't believe that this is a different world from the one I was in, or that this is the deepest part of the dungeon, but for now I'm going to follow your path. The only way is to follow you now. It seems that I am no match for you, no matter what I can do. ......"

　Lilicia said to herself.     
　I think I did something bad there.

「It's the first time I've seen a real domination.」    
「Well, if your pride and joy sword is broken by your arm, your heart will be broken too.」    
「Elf domination is a culture.」(Tl: I used the word domination cuz it somewhat passes the message, and I sure as hell don't want to write the note explaining what was actually meant to be there)   
「Shachiken is bad even by otherworldly standards.」   
「Oh, you're going to join the elves?」   
「Really, I'm getting excited.」    
「 We should keep her in the country for safekeeping.」    
「I'm sure it'll all work out.」    
「I'm afraid there's going to be a war over the elves.」

"Understood. Well then, let's go outside this barrier for now. This barrier is created by Lilicia, right?"   
"Yes. This is a spell created by the magical tool I have. The wards will be automatically created when you lose consciousness. This is a powerful ward that keeps evil people at bay. If you were able to enter it, it means you are not a bad person. I'm sorry."     
"It doesn't matter. It's natural to be wary when a dead-eyed person like me suddenly appears."    
"....... You are a surprisingly interesting person."

　Lilicia smiled for the first time when she came here.    
　Yes, she is still a very pretty person.

「Lilicia-tan hahaha.」   
「The heroine race is going to intensify.」    
「Please make a fan club soon.」    
「Please become a distributor.」   
「I can recommend this Erofu ......!」   
「I hope you come to the surface without incident.」   
「Flag Raised!」

　Me and Lilicia-san started walking out of the ward.    
　While we're there, I ask her something that's been bothering me.

"What were you doing before you came here?　Is it just a coincidence that you had the sword, the national treasure?"   
"......We were fighting a certain someone just before I lost consciousness.  "
　Lilicia spoke with a serious expression on her face.    
　I had expected it, she was right in the middle of a battle. The reason why she was so aggressive right after she woke up was probably due to the fact that she was in the middle of a battle right before she woke up.

"Who was the other party?"   
"The Demon King Lucifer ...... is a famous 'Demon King' in our world. He is one of the mighty demons who can manipulate numerous magic and terrifying necromancy techniques. I challenged Lucifer together with the elite of the elves."

　Lilicia's eyes were filled with fear as she spoke.   
　This Lucifer must have been a very strong and terrifying existence.

「Oh come on, there's even a demon king?」    
「I'm getting excited by the gruesome fantasy.」    
「I think Shachiken will be treated like a Demon King if he goes to another world.」    
「The Corporate Slave Demon King, Tanaka...... sounds great.」    
「I'm sure the heroes will despair.」   
「I think he's going to attack three times every turn.」    
「In addition, the physical and magical defenses are very hard....... It's the end」   
「And any status effect is completely nullified.」    
「Don't forget that the weapons you hit him with will break.」   
「This boss is to hard.」    
「He needs to be nerfed!!」

　What kind of a demon king was this feared so much?    
　Well, I'm curious, but I don't want to waste my time fighting. I'm glad I was sent here by Lilicia-san and not the Demon King.

"Alright."

　She and I went out of the ward together.   
　Then the wards faded away and disappeared. Lilicia-san's exit must have completed its task.

"Big brother! Are you okay?" 

　As soon as I got out of the ward, Dagosuke rushed over to me. Then...

"Na......!　Why are the servants of the evil god here!　You tricked me, Tanaka!"    
"Hey!? What is this elf? Did you create a new apprentice while I was here, big brother!"    
"...Please calm down a little."

　I was starting to get a headache from all the chatter.    
　I shut them both up for once and tell Dagosuke about Lilicia and Lilicia about Dagosuke.    
　Oh yeah, I haven't even told them about Riri yet. I tell her about Riri , too.

"Hey! I can't believe that a shoggoth is attached to people! Isn't that dangerous enough to destroy the city all by itself!?"    
"But you see, she's friendly. She won't hurt anyone."

　Seeing Riri rubbing her head against my finger and being sweet to me, Lilicia muttered in surprise, "Oh, really" ....... Apparently, it's very unusual.

"I'm relieved to hear from my brother that this young lady isn't an apprentice just because you met her inside."    
"I've never seen any human being befriending a servant of the Evil God. ......?　Tanaka, who are you really?"

　Dagosuke was relieved and Lilicia was puzzled.    
　Apparently, Dagosuke's friends are some pretty dangerous guys in another world. There are a lot of Riri's fans, and I think they are surprisingly talkative guys, but it seems they are different over there.

　While I was thinking about that, Dagosuke twisted his head and said, "Hmm?　That's strange,". What's going on?

"Is there something on your mind?"   
"Brother, there was only this cheeky-looking elf inside the warding, wasn't there?"   
"Oh. Yes, that's for sure."    
"But that doesn't make sense. You see, I told you that I felt a terrible presence from below the dungeon."

　He did indeed say that. We went all the way down to the lowest level to find out what it was.

"But this elf is not the presence I felt. What I sensed was something much scarier, much colder, much worse: ......!"

　The moment Dagosuke said this, the air suddenly turned cold.    
　I was alarmed and wondered what was going on,

"Thank you for breaking the ward."

　An unknown voice entered my ears, and at the same time, my vision was tinted black.    
　A strong shock hits my entire body. It was as if I had been hit by something magical. It was much heavier and sharper than Dagosuuke's attack.

"Die!"

　The ground was gouged out, and the entire space was pushed out.    
　My body was lifted up in the air by the mysterious attack, and I was pushed away with a cry.
