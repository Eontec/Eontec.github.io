…



"Brother!"

　Dagosuke's panicked voice echoed through the dungeon.    
　The place where Tanaka had been had been gouged out and obliterated by a mysterious attack.    
　Tanaka was no longer there, either blown away, ...... or obliterated.

　Dagosuke was worried, but there was no time to check on his safety.    
　This was because the person who had unleashed the attack had appeared in front of him.

　He wore a black cloak and had deep dark eyes. His black hair swayed suspiciously.    
　The man's face was well-shaped, but somewhat frightening

"I have been waiting for you, Princess Elf. You were right to hide."     
"......?　Why are you here ......?"

　Lilicia bit her teeth.   
　Although she tried to be strong, her face was filled with a strong color of fear.

　Dagosuuke, unable to grasp the situation, asks Lilicia   

"Who is that guy, girl? Do you know him?"    
"I don't know him at all. I was fighting with him just before I was sent here."  

　When she closed her eyes, she could still recall that battle.    
　The battle was that hard and painful.

"His name is Lucifer, the Demon King. The worst of the demons who spread death and chaos. We elves did everything in our power to defeat him."   
"The Demon King?　Why is such a dangerous person here?"

　Even Dagosuke, who had little contact with the human world, knew about the Demon King.    
　The Demon King is a man of exceptional talent among the 『Demon Clan』 who manipulates powerful magic. His power was so powerful and vicious that he alone could bring down a whole country.

「A Demon King?」     
「This is finally getting to the point of fantasy.」    
「He's going to give us half the world!」   
「I mean, is Shachiken going to be okay?」    
「I'm sure Shachiken will be fine. ...... probably.」    
「Tanaka!　Are you okay?」    
「But I've never seen Shachiken get blown away like that before. Isn't it really dangerous?」    
「Oh no, our Shachiken is .......」

　The drone, which luckily was safe and sound, captured the Demon King.    
　 Basically, the drone follows the object it is filming, but when it loses sight of the object, the AI automatically determines what the viewers are currently interested in and films it.      z
　When the target disappeared and the viewer's attention was focused on the Demon King, the drone would automatically take a picture of that object.

"From what I can tell, this is a different world from the one we were in. But if we can come here, we can go home. First, I will kill you, and then I will slowly search for a way to return home."

　Lucifer, the Demon King, slowly approached.   
　Lilicia let out a small scream. Then,

"Hey, wait for me!"

　Dagosuuke intervened between Lucifer and Lilicia.   
　He glares at Lucifer and raises his voice.

"Why do you keep on messing about while you leave me alone?　How dare you surprise my brother like that!"    
"...... Look who it is, a race of servants of the evil gods. Why do you, who have nothing to do with humans, defend the elves?"    
"Shut up!　 I don't know about you, but I'm not going to allow you to touch my brother . I'm going to deal with you!"

　Dagosuke was so enthusiastic, but his legs were trembling.    
　He knew full well that there was a gap in strength between him and his opponent.

「Dagosuke, you can do it!」    
「You showed us a man.」    
「You have a very high opinion of Shachiken, don't you?」    
「I'm fine with you being Shachiken's apprentice.」    
「Yay, Dagosuke!」    
「You're number one!」    
「Dagosuke is also rank EX, you know. I'm sure he's good enough to be the Demon King.」    
「We'll defeat the enemy!」    
「Make amends for Tanaka's death!」    
「Shachiken's dead!」    
「And protect the Elf!」

　Dagosuke took a deep breath and glared at Lucifer sharply.   
　Then he kicked the ground sharply and ran off.

"Get him!"

　Dagosuke extended the sharp fins of his forearms and swung his arms.    
　His flipper was so sharp that it surpassed the sharpness of an ordinary sword.

"Sharp ray ・ fin slash!"

　He swung his arm as hard as he could and slashed at the Demon King Lucifer.   
　Just before the attack hits, Lucifer held up his right arm to Dagosuuke and muttered quietly, 

"You're an eyesore"

　Instantly, a mass of black magic shot out from his hand and hit Dagosuke.   
　The shockwave was so strong that Dagosuke was blown away and rolled many times on the ground.

"G...ah...!?" 

　Dagosuke had confidence in his own toughness.    
　However, the attack was so tremendous that his confidence was obliterated with a single blow. His entire body was numb, and he could hardly stand up, let alone move his fingers.

"As I expected, those who are related to the evil gods are very strong," 

　Lucifer said as if he was impressed.    
　He approached Dagosuuke to finish him off, but this time Lilicia stood in his way.    

"You ...... are mine to defeat!"    
"Your hands are shaking. Can you do it in this situation without your friends?"    
"Shut up, I must absolutely ...... defeat you. For the sake of my fallen comrades, I absolutely ...... must!"

　Lilicia said with tears in her eyes.     
　She had a reason why she absolutely had to win.
