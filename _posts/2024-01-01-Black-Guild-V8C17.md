Tl: Sam


…



"YOU? Kill ME?　You make me laugh. You sacrificed your friends, but you couldn't stand up to me."

　Lucifer, the Demon King, laughed mockingly at Lilicia.    
　Yes, she and her fellow elves challenged Lucifer to a fight.

　They created a ward to weaken the demon clan, suppressed their power to less than half, and then struck him with magic with more than a hundred elves.    
　But even so, it was not enough to defeat Lucifer. Many of his fellow elves died before his eyes. Lilicia, who was leading them, felt a strong responsibility for it.

"She was responsible for the deaths of so many of her fellow elves. The Elves' greatest treasure is like a piece of trash if it is broken like that."    
"Damn ......!"
<!--more-->

　 

"This is all Shachiken's fault."    
"The side of the sword that breaks is at fault, too."   
"It was a force majeure."(Tl: Means "Greater force")    
"I mean, the demon king is too bad. Lilicia can't win."    
"What should we do now that Shachiken has gone away?"    
"Dagosuke!　What are you sleeping for?

　Tanaka was nowhere to be seen, and Dagosuke was down.     
　Lilicia, realizing that there was no help in sight, gripped her treasured sword and faced the Demon Lord.

"I'll make up for the grudge of my countrymen killed by you, right here!"    
"Try it out. At least make me a little less bored."   

　Lilicia kicked the ground and approached Lucifer.    
　 She put magic into the hand that was not holding the treasured sword, and then she cast a spell.

"Wind, tear!"

　Countless blades of wind shot out from Lilicia's hand and struck Lucifer.    
　The blades were powerful enough to cut through steel, but when they hit Lucifer, they shattered and not even his clothes were affected!

"Spirit magic, interesting. But that level of power won't even be enough to cut my fingernails."    
"Shut up!　I will defeat you with my own hands!"

　Lilicia poured all her magic power into the treasured sword and stabbed Lucifer with it.    
　The treasured sword she holds, Eefa, is said to have been struck from light, and is the supreme treasure of the elves. It is especially effective against demons, and its power becomes even more powerful when infused with the holy magical power of the elves.

　Even the most powerful demon king could be defeated with this treasured sword,.......

"It's sad to say that you don't have any power."   
"What ......?"

　Lucifer had caught the sword with his bare hands.
　Even though he was holding the blade casually, not a single drop of blood had fallen from his hand.

 "This sword certainly seems to have great power against demons, but in the first place there is too much of a difference in power between you and me. No matter how good a weapon you have, that difference cannot be bridged."

　Lucifer then struck Lilicia with the hand that was not holding the sword.
　

"Guh....Uh..."

　The intense pain spread throughout her body.    
　Lilicia tried to stand up, but her body was not strong enough.

　Tears welled up in her eyes as feelings of frustration, inadequacy, and helplessness spread through her chest.    
　The faces of her friends come to her mind. But she could not avenge their disappearance.

"Now, it's time for me to end this. I have a lot of research to do on this world."

　Lucifer slowly approached Lilicia.    
　After he had killed her, he wanted to learn more about this world and then wield its power as he saw fit. Although he had not yet gone above ground, he sensed the presence of a large number of humans in the outside world.     
　Although he was reluctant to be driven out of his former world, there were plenty of toys to be found in this world. Lucifer was looking forward to getting out into the outside world.

"Well, now let's finish it. ......Nn?"

　Lucifer stopped when he heard a rattling sound.    
　The sound was the crumbling of debris on the wall.

"Ah,That was quite the surprise. What do you mean?" 

　Tanaka emerged from the rubble.      
　He walked toward Lucifer, brushing the dirt off his clothes.

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

"Tanaka, you're alive!"    
"I believed in you, Shachiken." (Tl: Oh My God, woww, that's crazy)   
"I knew it."   
"Yes, I knew it."    
"Why are you just saying you were surprised when the Demon King attacked you?"
" He's unharmed."    
"It's like the representative of Earth vs. the representative of another world, without even realizing it."    
"I was feeling desperate just now, but suddenly I'm feeling relieved."

　The comment section was excited by Tanaka's appearance.   
　Meanwhile, Lucifer stops moving when he saw Tanaka's appearance.

(...... Are you saying that this human was safe from my magic?)

　Lucifer was confused.    
　The first blow was released with the intention of killing. Even the aftermath would shatter a human being if it hit.

"He was hit so suddenly that my reaction was delayed. I was buried in the ground and couldn't tell which way was up, and thanks to that...... I had a hard time getting back."

(Why did I attack this guy in the first place?　He was a normal guy, not much to look at. I should have tried to attack the elf at first. And yet......)

　When Lucifer found Tanaka and the others coming out of the ward, he tried to attack Lilicia with magic. However, on the verge of doing so, he shifted his target to Tanaka. It was an unconscious action, and he did not understand why he did so.

"It was impossible for me to judge him as dangerous. He is neither an elf nor a dragon, just a human being."    
"Nn? Who are you? Isn't it hot in that black cloak?"

"lmao."    
"Well, that's what you get if you don't understand the situation."   
"That's the first thing you say to the Demon Lord?"    
"I feel at home."    

"Do you ...... think I'm a fool, the Demon Lord?"    
"Oh, the Demon Lord?　There was a time when I wanted to say something like that too,......, but you'd better graduate from that kind of thing as soon as possible."  

"That's too much lol."   
"It's getting exciting."   
"You're treating the demon king as a chuunibyou lol"    
"I'm sorry, but there was a time when Shachiken was like that....... lol."    
"He's looking at you like you're a poor thing."    
"I'm trying to be considerate, but all I'm doing is making things worse."    
"What's going to happen now?"    
"As expected of Shachiken. Business as usual."

"...... enough is enough. I'll take care of you just like I took care of these guys."

　Lucifer put black magic power on his right hand and tried to hit Tanaka with it.   
　Tanaka, however, was unfazed and responded calmly to Lucifer's words.

"I see, you did it to Dagosuke and Lilicia, didn't you?"

　Tanaka's eyes suddenly narrowed and he gets into a fighting stance.    
　His right arm moved with blinding speed, and he thrust it into the demon king Lucifer's cheek.

"What...!?" 

　He then swung his fist as hard as he could and blew Lucifer away.   
　Lucifer, who bounced several times on the ground, managed to regain his stance and landed on the ground.

(Ridiculous!　What is this guy ......?)

　He always protects himself with strong magical armor.     
　However, the cheek where he was hit was throbbing. It doesn't look like he used magic, which means that the opponent broke through the magical armor with only 『 Phhysical Strenght 』.

　By a mere human. Impossible.    
　Lucifer felt extremely confused.

　Tanaka walked toward him.

"I don't know who you are or who the Demon King is,......, but you hurt my friend, and I won't let you go for free."    
"Kukuku ...... interesting. I'm sure you'll be more entertaining than that elf."
