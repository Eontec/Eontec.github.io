"He hit that demon king with his bare hands, ...... that's impossible. Who in the world is that human ......?"

　Lilicia, an elf who saw Tanaka's attack, muttered in surprise.   
　The demon king Lucifer is an outstanding person who is well-known even in the other world. His strength is outstanding.

　It's strength rank is EX III.    
　The Japanese government calls that class of creature the "continent annihilation class".     
　It is so strong that it is not a single creature, but a gigantic disaster. It should be no match for a single individual.

"Are you all right, girl?"
<!--more-->

　As Lilicia wondered whether she should join him, Dago came to her side and stopped her.

"Don't worry, you're safe now that your brother is here. We'd better stay out of the way."   
"But... But..!　The other party is that demon king!　A human being is no match for him!"    
"Yes, if he were a normal human being."

　Dagosuke said as he looked at Tanaka.

"He's not normal I've seen a lot of scary evil gods, but ...... he's more unfathomable than any of them. Watch and you'll find out soon enough."    
"............"

　Lilicia, admonished by Dagosuke, decided to keep quiet and watch the battle.

　On the other hand, Tanaka is approaching the demon king Lucifer at a brisk pace.

"He certainly has a great amount of magical power, and he calls himself the Demon King."   
"You are a cocky talker," 

　Lucifer raised his right hand, and several jet-black swords appeared around Tanaka.    
　All of them were of a disfiguring shape and contained a high amount of magic power.

"Die!"

　Lucifer commanded, and all the swords shot out at Tanaka at once.    
　Each of these swords, filled with the demon king's magical power, had a high killing power, capable of slaughtering even an S-rank monster.

　Tanaka grabbed all those swords ...... with his bare hands.

"Yo tsu...."

　He held the sword between his fingers and gripped it.    
　The swords would stop just like that.

　Then, Tanaka put his power into the swords, and they shattered with a cracking sound! Lucifer, Lilicia, and Dagosuke were stunned to see the swords break as easily as if they were from a gag cartoon.

"Ah, it's impossible. My dark sword ......."    
"What just happened ......?"    
"As expected of you, brother, you're unbelievable......."

「Everyone is so surprised.」    
「Is this your first time seeing Shachiken?　Relax your shoulders.」    
「I'm not sure what to say!　You've got to get rid of that guy!」   
「The Demon King has no luck at all.......」    
「We've got company livestock that's even worse than the heroes.」

　Lucifer was upset that his attack was easily blocked, but he quickly regained his composure and began to create his next spell.

"I see, That's Impressive. How about this?　Summon Summon: Elder Demon!"

　A magic circle appeared on the ground, and a huge demon, about five meters long, appeared there.     
　The demon lunged toward Tanaka with a terrifying cry. The viewers were horrified even through the screen by its terrifying appearance.

「Heh?」    
「What is this guy?」    
「He's so scary!」    
「Can you summon such a thing?」     
「The Demon King's name isn't just for show」

　The Elder Demon is an advanced demon that can manipulate numerous types of magic.      
　Its strength surpasses that of the ferocious Tyrant Dragon.

" Waga-ryu kenjutsu, shin-ata-taki."(Tl: Blink, but a longer name "blink of an eye" for some reason, probably as a clarification cuz the word has some other meanings)

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

　The Elder Demon was cut down by a single sword faster than it could wield its power.    
　The Elder Demon, with its strong body, was no match for the well-honed swordsmanship Tanaka.

「It was an instant kill, lol」   
「This is too much...」    
「Lilicia-tan is so cute with her big mouth open in surprise.」   
「I bet it would be a nasty monster in the other world.」    
「I'm sure it's a nasty monster here, too.」   
「I'm losing my mind.」     
「In fact, even an S-ranked explorer would have a hard time defeating it.......」

"This... then I'll just push through with numbers! Summon: Skeleton Army !"

　Countless skeletons appeared and attacked Tanaka like an avalanche.   
　Although the fighting power of each individual was not great, if he were swallowed by this number, he would be in big trouble.

"How can a human being handle this number!"    
"......It sure would be a hassle to deal with them one by one."

　Tanaka muttered to himself, crouching down on the spot and thrusting his hands into the ground.

「What are you doing?」    
「It's nothing good either way.」   
「I hope.」    
「Digging in the ground and running away?」    
「That's not a good idea, Tanaka.」    
「I can't imagine Shachiken running away...」

　The comment section was excited.     
　Tanaka put his hand in the ground and putting a lot of force into his hand, he thrust into the ground and turned the ground over as hard as he could. ・・・・・・・

"Oraaa!　Bedrock flip!"    
“”””Gaaaaaah!””””

　The entire ground was overturned and the skeleton army was swallowed up by it.     
　It looked as if a landslide had occurred, and not a single skeleton remained.

"Phew, that's refreshing."

　Tanaka wiped his forehead as if he had done a good job.       
　Lucifer, who had been watching the whole process, was stunned for a moment, then put on a serious expression.

"...... human being. What is your name?"    
"Hm?　My name is Makoto Tanaka."    
"Tanaka, let me first apologize for my rudeness in underestimating you. Now I know that I came to this world to fight you."    

　Lucifer's body leaked out a thick magical essence.    
　He understood that the person in front of him was worthy of being taken seriously.

"All my life I have been thirsty. There was no one strong enough to fill me in the world I was born into....... I have been waiting for someone like you, someone who I could take seriously!"

　Jet-black wings sprouted from Lucifer's back.     
　Tanaka, seeing this, reacted with a smile, "Wow, it's like the second form in a game."
