"I commend you. I've never had anyone make me look like this before."      
"I see. That's an honour."

「You don't think so at all lol.」     
「You just want to go home.」    
「It's about time.」    
「You've got to deal with Lucifer-kun.」
<!--more-->

"So much for showing some leeway. Black Dawn"

　Lucifer held up his hand, and a storm of black magic power erupted, blowing Tanaka out of the space.      
　The force of the blast was so powerful that a crack appeared in the space!　   

"Whoa!"   
"I won't play, I'll crush you with everything I've got, Tanaka! Summon: Giant Demon!"

　A giant daemon appeared and knocked Tanaka, who was floating in midair, to the ground. The giant demon then slammed his huge fist into the ground.

『 Gaaaaaaaaaaaah ！！』

　With each fist strike, the dungeon shook violently, and cracks appeared in the ground.     
　The giant demon's power was that out of the norm.

「Uoooh!」     
「Eh, Tsuyo.」     
「you're so nervous lol.」   
「He's definitely the strongest enemy we've ever had.」

　The Demon King Lucifer was an undefeated demon in another world.     
　He was not only well versed in magic, but also in necromancy, and his ability and knowledge were outstanding among the demon tribe.     
　Before him, the vicious demon Demon hung its head and pledged its allegiance.

　He was the strongest and most fearsome of all.       
　No one could match him, or so he thought.

Until ---- this day.



　The giant demon's torso was sliced in half and it collapsed.       
　The one who emerged from the cloud of dust was a sprightly Tanaka.

"You got my clothes all dirty....... haha."

「How did you get away with that?」    
「I knew it.」    
「He's so strong it's scary.」    
「I'll give you a prize for dirtying up my suit.」    
「You did good, Giant Demon-kun.」

　Lucifer, who had summoned his subordinates and had them killed instantly, still kept smiling.     
　He was so happy to have met such a powerful man.

"Tanaka, it's amazing. How could you train so well in the body of a human being?"

　Lucifer praised him heartily.

"What do you think? Are you willing to wield that power under me? Well, when I rule this world..."     
"You're not going to give me half the world, are you?　I don't want that."    
"...I see. That's a shame."        
"Were you really going to do that...... or is the Demon King like this in every world?"

　Tanaka said dumbfounded.    
　He didn't find half of the world appealing at all.

"You mean to tell me that you have that much power and are content with the status quo?　The powerful have the right to be rulers."    
"If I work moderately, get paid moderately, and have a drink with my friends once in a while, that's enough for me. I don't want more than that. If I got half of the world, it would be hard work.'

　Tanaka laughed it off.     
　Hearing those words, Lucifer muttered regretfully, "I see".

"Then ...... I'll let you die here."

　A cold, dense magic energy was released from Lucifer's body and filled the space.     
　The concentration of the magic element was so high that even Lilicia and Dagosuke, both of whom have high magic element levels, felt sick. If they were normal people, they would have fallen into magic poisoning in an instant.

"Tanaka, you are strong. But I have a higher amount of magic. I am not a fool not to notice the difference."      
"...It's true that as it is now... it might be difficult to beat you." 

　Tanaka readily admitted it.      
　He was aware that at this rate, we would eventually run out of strength first.

「Are you kidding?　Shachiken can lose?」     
「Is he no match for the Demon King? ......」     
「Hey, hey, it's over.」     
「Tanakaaa!　You're lying, aren't you?」      
「No, I believe in you, Shachiken!」     
「I'm going to cry.」

　Anxiety spread among the viewers.    
　Seeing Tanaka, who maturely admitted defeat, the demon king Lucifer smiled.

"Well, that's refreshing. Then ......."    
"Ah... what a shame. If you had gotten here an hour earlier, you might have won."     
"Nn?"

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

　Lucifer tilted his head at Tanaka's words.     
　The truth is that even if they were an hour earlier, it wouldn't seem to make any difference. He was puzzled as to what on earth he was talking about when Tanaka showed him the watch he was wearing.

"It's 6:23 p.m....... past the closing time. From here on out, regular working hours will not be the same as before."

　Tanaka then removed his tie and threw away his suit jacket.

「What's going to happen?」   
「Don't lose, Shachiken!」     
「Have you finally gone crazy?」     
「I seriously don't understand the flow.」    
「What's going to happen?」

　The viewers were puzzled.     
　Despite them, Tanaka continued to speak.

"I was never the type of person who could fight for a long period of time. After two hours of fighting, I was too tired to move."

　Tanaka recalls his days as a company employee.      
　If you were exploring a normal dungeon, you could just take breaks in between, so there was no problem with that, but that wasn't the case when I was a company slave and had a harsh quota. 

"But work doesn't take that into account.  As I spent many hours a day working overtime, I was forced to change my strategy."

　From a short-term strategy to a long-term strategy.    
　Tanaka had to change his style in order to meet the endless quotas that came at him.

　So, Tanaka asked Kaoru Shiwa, a blacksmith, to make something for him.

The tie I just took off is a 『 shackle 』. That tie has a powerful effect of suppressing the output of magical elements. Naturally, by doing so, my power is weakened, but by reducing the output, I made it possible for me to endure long hours of work."   
'What?　What are you saying ......?"

　Lucifer was puzzled.     
　If Tanaka was right, he had been limiting his power until now. He couldn't believe that.

"The use of various materials from the depths of the dungeon to strengthen the shackles had made them a cursed item that could not be removed during regular hours, but now that the ...... regular hours had passed, the curse was lifted."

　Tanaka announced, immersed in the power that was welling up in him.

"Let's ---- get a little serious for the first time in a while."

　Tanaka loosens the cork of strength he had been tightening a little.    
　Then, a huge amount of magic energy was released from his body, instantly replacing Lucifer's magic energy that had filled the space.      

"What the ......?

　Lucifer exclaimed.    
　Tanaka turned to him.

"I'm sorry, but I have no interest in prolonging overtime work. I'll finish it as soon as possible and return home."
