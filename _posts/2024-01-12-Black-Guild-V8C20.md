　Overtime mode.    
　This was Tanaka's special mode.

　The magical element emanating from his body was so dense that it could be visualized, overwhelming not only those present but even those watching through the images. 

「What?　You've been suppressing your power until now, ...... Koto！？」    
「No, no, no, that's a lie.」     
「But you're giving off some kind of aura like you're a real fighting race.」      
「You're a super coporate slave.」    
「I think he's got a mind of his own.」    
<!--more-->
「Shachiken still has two transformations left. You know what this means, don't you?」     
「It's so bad, I can't even get grass.」    

"Thirty percent ...... or maybe even forty percent, I guess that much is okay."

　Tanaka muttered to himself and stopped in the middle of his walk, staring intently at Lucifer floating in mid-air.    
　Then, he puts some strength into his legs and suddenly disappeared from the scene....

"......!!!!"    

　Lucif immediately created a spherical ward to cover himself.    
　It was a superior magic created by combining the best of his magical skills. It could easily prevent the dragon's breath. But....

"There..."

　Tanaka's fist suddenly appeared in front of him and easily crushed him.     
The fist, fired at high speed, broke through the boundary and hit Lucifer in the abdomen. With its tremendous speed and power, the fist distorted the space around it.
「What's with the space distortion?」    
「I thought my screen was buggy!」    
「This is the Great Monster War, isn't it?」    
「Japanese salarymen are so strong!(English)」(Tl: Ah the foreigners are back)    
「Gaijin niki, it's a misunderstanding.......」    
「It's not like that」

"But, ah ......?!"

　And Lucifer, who had taken a serious hit from it, sobbed and blew up, crashing to the ground.    
　Lucifer had fought many times and suffered many powerful attacks, but this was the first time he had felt such pain.

(What an attack, did he get hit in the internal organs ......?)

　Concentrating the magic element inside his body, Lucifer repaired his damaged internal organs.   
　He, too, was a person with a power far removed from that of an ordinary creature. But even he could not imagine a vision of victory over the man standing before him.
"Who are you, ......?"   
I'm just a passing salaryman. Well, a former one."
" Salaryman?　I don't know the word, but you must be very powerful in this world."    
"Yes, I am. Yes, I am the strongest.      

　When Tanaka raised his sword, Lucifer also created a jet-black sword and prepared to use it.    
　The difference in ability between the two sides was obvious. However, his pride as a Demon King and his desire to fight against the strong, forced him to continue the battle.

"I'm so happy, Tanaka, my blood is boiling...!!"

　 Lucifer made countless swords appear around him and shot them all out at once.    
　He then built the next magic while approaching Tanaka himself at high speed.

"Dimensional magic, next commandment sealing lock!"     

　Suddenly, chains appeared from the space around Tanaka, binding him.    
　It binds the target in space, the highest rank of binding magic. There has never been a single person who has been unable to be restrained from moving by this magic of Lucifer's. But..,

"Hmph!"

　Tanaka destroyed it with muscle power alone.    
　He then struck down all the jet-black swords coming his way, and next, he intercepted Lucifer.

"Tanaka!"

　Lucifer activates the magical element in his body and strengthened his muscles.      
　The sword strike unleashed by Lucifer had the power to cut down a mountain, but Tanaka caught it with his sword with a. The ground cracked and the space was distorted by the impact, but Tanaka's torso did not shake at all.


"Anyone who works more than 350 hours of overtime a month can do this."

「I can't do it.」   
「I'm going to die!」    
「Even if you get over that, you'll just become a cripple.」    
「What do you mean, I was just working overtime at work......?」    
「It's amazing how serious he is.」   
「Good kids, don't imitate him!」    
「Don't imitate, good companies!」    

　Tanaka flicked the sword he was catching, and this time he unleashed a sharp kick that blew Lucifer away.    
　After bouncing several times on the ground, Lucifer regained his stance. However, his strength had been sapped considerably by Tanaka's heavy attacks on his body.

"Ze, ze ...... that's fine. I will show you everything I have."

　As he said this, Lucifer's body began to glow.    
　Then his jet-black hair, clothes, and wings turned 'pure white. His hair, clothes, and wings turn "pure white," and even a halo floated above his head, making him look like an "angel," rather than a demon king.
