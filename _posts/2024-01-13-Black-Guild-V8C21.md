…



　Lucifer, the Demon King, was once an angel.    
　Although he lost his power as an angel and now fought with magic and necromancy, he has developed a secret technique that allows him to regain his angelic power.

　That is "Shinmamakureta" (reversal of divine and demonic powers).    
　By reversing the demonic power he acquired by falling into heaven, he succeeded in regaining his former power.
<!--more-->

　However, his demonized body rejected the power of angels.    
　While using the cutthroat angel seraphim mode, his body gradually collapsed.

　In other words, this state lasts only a few minutes and is also accompanied by severe pain.     
　But Lucifer had no regrets. If he did not give his all here and now, when would he do so? He was ready to give it everything he had.

"Heaven's Fall"

　Lucifer raised his right hand, and countless particles of light appeared above his head.    
　Then, as he lowers his right hand, the particles of light pour down in unison on Tanaka below.

「Hii!」    
「The scale of the battle is too big.」     
「This is already the Final War Ragnarok, isn't it?」    
「It looks like a religious painting. ......」      
「Please!　I hope it's CG!」    
「Can you do it, Shachiken?」    
「He's working overtime, he can do it.」

　A rain of light falling on him.     
　Each one of these raindrops boasts enormous power, but Tanaka met it head on.

"Yo, ha!"

　Tanaka repelled the light particles with his bare hands.    
　He hit them with his hand as if he was trying to get rid of a winged insect. Of course, the light particles were so numerous that Tanaka's arm movements were too fast for ordinary people to catch.     
　The viewers were confused by his movements, which seemed to be in fast forward.

「I can't see his arms.」      
「The frame rate is losing.」   
「Good luck, drone-kun!」    
「You're doing a great job!」    
「It's too fast, it looks like it's stopped.」    
「I don't know how to say that except as a gag.......」    
「The arm movement is creepy, but why don't you start with the fact that he's parrying the light with his bare hands?」    

"This is not even enough to wound you...... then!"

　Lucifer, who had been blocked by all the light bullets, approached Tanaka at high speed as a sword of light appeared in both hands.    
　Seraphim Sword, the cutthroat's judgment sword. The sword he created is an angel's sword vine with super high heat. The sword, which cuts through any armor, was the top-of-the-line weapon he could create. But....

"It's hot."

　Tanaka caught it with both hands.    
　With one hand gripping the blade of each sword. It was a much more advanced technique than the serious shirahadatori.

"Ei."

　When Tanaka said that and put strength into both hands, the Seraphim Sword, the cutthroat's sword of judgment, shattered with a clang!　      
　Lucifer, who saw the Seraphim Sword break for the first time, looked astonished. 

"I guess it's my turn next."

　Tanaka seized the opportunity and readied his fist.    
　Lucifer regained his composure at the terrifyingly deadly force and took a defensive stance with the pure white wings on his back outstretched in front of him. The feathers of an angel are each frighteningly hard and function as the strongest shield.

　But Tanaka's fist, which was working overtime ......, was harder than that.    
　The actual fist, which was released while twisting space, easily shattered the feathers of the cutthroat angel and hit Lucifer in the abdomen without losing momentum.

"Ooooooooh!"

　Lucifer rolled on the ground like a piece of wood blown away by a typhoon.      
　His clothes were torn, his whole body was wounded, and his wings were shredded.

He also remembered the strong pain all over his body due to the side effects of the angel seraphim mode. But even so, Lucifer was smiling happily. His smile was pure and innocent, as if he was a child who had not been played with by his parents in a long time.

"I didn't expect to see you here ....... I didn't know that a strong man like you existed,....... I am ashamed of myself for taking pride in being the strongest."

　Lucifer stood up, blood streaming from the edges of his mouth.

  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

"Having so much power, don't you feel empty? I can't believe there are many strong people like you in this world."      
"...... not that there aren't times when I feel that way. That is why."

　Tanaka grabbed the sword that was attached to his waist and readied it.

  "Come with all your might."

　Lucifer rolled his eyes at Tanaka's words.    
　And after that, he smiled happily. He reconstructed his angel wings and floated in the air.

"Then, taking your word for it, I will give it my all. With my strongest secret technique, I will strike you!"

　The light converges in Lucifer's right hand.     
　The light quickly increased in intensity, and soon it became difficult to look directly at it.

「Whoa, glare!」     
「What are you doing?」   
「 Drone-kun, are you okay?」   
「Let's do it, Shachiken!」   
「It's too bright, I can't see!」   

　As the luminosity increased, the temperature in the space also rose rapidly.    
　Light itself is a mass of energy. Lucifer's secret is to compress the light to its limit and release it.    
　However, the temperature at the center of the light exceeded 1,000,000 degrees Celsius. It could be described as a small "sun". Lucifer's own body was burning from the heat.

"Do you understand? If this thing were to hit this Earth, it would have enough energy to destroy its core."    

「Seriously?」    
「Suddenly it's too bad, lol.」   
「Don't throw that thing.」    
「The Earth is dead.」    
「These guys are the only ones with a strange view of the world.」 

"This is my last trick......."

　Lucifer released a ball of light aimed at Tanaka.     
　Then an ultra-hot beam of light was shot toward Tanaka. This was his final technique, "Aken no Akusei" (The Bright Morning Star). This is a special technique that he has never used on anyone before.

　Tanaka stared straight at it and put all his strength into the sword in his hand.

"Waga-ryu kenjutsu, shin shiki ----"

　Bending over at the waist, Tanaka assumed the form of iai, which can only be used in overtime mode.     
　It is his true swordsmanship, which can only be used in overtime mode.

　The combination of the strength of Wagaryu and the flexibility of Tachibana-ryu makes it impossible for even light to escape from his swordsmanship.

"Shinsen."

　He muttered shortly, and an invisible sword flash was released.     
　The speed of the iai, which greatly exceeded the speed at which living things can perceive it, cuts off air, sound, and even light.    
　Even the torrent of light, which could burn away even the stars, hangs its head in front of the sword flash. The bundle of light that has been so neatly cut into two pieces dispersed and vanished.

"It's wonderful......."

　Lucifer mutters with his eyes wide open.    
　Tanaka's sword flash cut off the torrent of light and deeply cut into Lucif's body.    
　Lucifer fell to the ground with a satisfied smile on his face, while still bleeding profusely from the scars etched into his body.

"You were strong, but you had the wrong ...... opponent."
