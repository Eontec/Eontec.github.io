…



　After successfully completing the battle, I took a breath.

"Fuu." 
  
　 It had been a while since I had used the Zangyo mode, so I was a little tired. I guess I should work on my endurance more. Mr. Dojima told me, "The best way to build up stamina is to dive." Maybe I should give it a try, since he said over drinks, "Won't you dive with me to the deep sea next time?"

「Whoa whoa whoa!　Shachiken won!」    
「You're too strong!」     
「Who can beat you!」      
「Demon king, you got smashed head on!」     
<!--more-->
「Shachiken is the best!　Shachiken is the best」      
「I really thought you were in trouble this time.」     
「If it wasn't for Shachiken, I shudder to think what would have happened if that thing had come to earth.」     
「Tanaka!　Thank you!」     

"WOW."

　When I turned on the display of comments, a large number of comments flowed into the hologram screen.     
　I can't keep up with them, but it seems that many people were satisfied. Good, good.

"Uh, I'm pretty sure there's a ...... somewhere around here."

　I found my tie and jacket on the messed up ground and put them on.    
　The tie removed the "Overtime mode" and restricted my power as usual. Since I had already gotten used to this state, I could not take off the tie even in my personal life. I wear the tie when I sleep and when I take a bath, which makes me look like a weirdo.

　But if I take it off, I can't control my power well and end up breaking doorknobs and the like. It's a pain in the ass.

"Brother, are you all right?"

　After putting on his jacket, Dagosuke came running toward me.      
　Behind him is the elven princess, Lilicia. The two of them fought quite spectacularly, but it seems that both of them are safe.

"Well, did you defeat the Demon King?! I can't see him though."     
"Yeah. I don't know if he's dead or not, but he won't be able to fight anymore."    
“Here you go, big brother! I knew you could do it.” 

　He's a good guy, that's for sure.     
　But this guy didn't run away and protected Lilithia-san while I was gone. He has a lightweight personality, but he is surprisingly dependable. Maybe a little like Adachi.

"I can't believe ...... that he beat that Lucifer all by himself."

　The elven princess Lilicia muttered to herself as she looked in the direction Lucifer fell.     
　Her clothes were torn in some places, but she didn't seem to be injured.

「Thank God. Lilicia-tan is safe.」     
「Ho.」    
「We can't afford to lose a precious elf, you know.」    
「She already has a fan club, right?」   
「She's ripped her clothes, it's too much.」    
「I'm sure she's an erofu.」    
「She can't be a princess with this body.」

　As usual, when she appeared on the screen, many sexually harassing comments flowed.    
　She doesn't seem to be comfortable with these comments, so I had to make sure she didn't see them.

"And it's hard to believe ...... that it was accomplished by a single human being, but now that I've seen it with my own eyes, I can't turn away."

　Lilicia-san came close to me and stared at me with a serious expression on her face.     
　She looked like a child when she was ranting, but she certainly had the grace of a princess when she did so.

"She looked at me with a serious expression on her face. Thanks to you, my people's regret has been fulfilled. I will not forget this favor, and I will certainly repay it."    
"I don't care. I was only doing my job."

　I did not fight for a mission.  It would be enough if I could get a thank you from Dojima-san.    

"I can't let that happen!　I said I'd thank you, so take it!"    
"I said I don't want it because it's from ......."

　An elf's gratitude is kind of scary.    
　I wouldn't want to be given something like a forest as a gift.     

「You're refusing so much!」    
「You're so selfless!」     
「Well, I can see why you'd be a little hesitant.」
「Maybe you could get Lilithia to be your wife in the future?」    
「She's actually doing heroic work, you know.」    
「Shachiken the Brave.」     
「A company man, a sword saint, a company president, and a hero......... is getting a little congested with attributes.」     

　We argued for a while about not needing to thank her.   
　I persistently refused, but Lilithia was quite stubborn and the conversation went on a parallel track.

"Ha, ha,......, you're pretty stubborn."     
"I'm not going to let you win, Tanaka,....... I'm sure we'll talk about it again when we've calmed down."     
"Yes, that's right. I also have to check on the Demon King's condition..." 

　We put the conversation on hold and headed for the place where Lucifer fell.     
　 While moving the large debris out of the way, we continue on our way. As I searched for the magic essence that I could still feel, I soon found Demon King Lucifer.

"I see you've found me."

　Lucifer smiles wryly.      
　Although he had a relaxed expression on his face, his body had been cut in half from the torso.
