…



　The demon king Lucifer's body had been cut in half by my slash.     
　From the waist down, his body was gone, and a large amount of blood was flowing down from the severed surface.

　Even though the Demon King is much sturdier than a normal human, he would not be able to survive if he was bleeding this much.

"Wait a little."
<!--more-->

　Even though he was my enemy, I couldn't let him die like this. I went into my pocket and pulled out a restorative potion and tried to heal him,

"It's ...... all right. I am satisfied, there is no need to treat me."

　The demon king refused.     
　Indeed, the demon king looked satisfied. It doesn't look like he was trying to be strong or deceitful.    
　If he refused to do so, the effect of the recovery potion would be less effective. I put away the restorative potion without forcing him to do so.

　The demon king, smiling with satisfaction at this, opened his mouth.

"Tanaka, I am grateful to you. I have never felt so fulfilled in my life....... That is why I am sorry. I could not bring out the best in you ......."

　The demon king lowers his eyes and says apologetically.

"...... that's not true."    
"No need to be modest. I couldn't bring out even half of your full potential,...... I didn't think you had such heights. I should have trained more diligently."

　The demon king raised his gaze and stared into my eyes.     
　The color of his face was getting worse and worse. It seemed that his last moment was near.

"Tanaka, let me ask you one thing. Do you not feel vain with such power?　I did. Therefore, I have invaded various tribes and nations to fight the powerful, waiting for someone to come along and defeat me.
......Well, there are certainly times when I think about that."

　Fighting with limited strength is inevitably stressful.      
　I'm not saying that I don't want to fight spontaneously sometimes, too.

"But fighting isn't all there is to it. If I can have dinner with my good friends, drink sake, and talk about trivial things, I'm surprisingly satisfied."     
"I see."

　The demon king said as if he had been convinced.    
　The demon king's body gradually collapsed from one end to the other. It seems that he was at his limit to maintain his body.

　As he looked on, the elf Lilicia came up beside him.

"Lucifer, the Demon King...... it seems that you are finally finished."    
"An elf princess? Nice, that's good. Even that dull pillow can easily decapitate me now."      
"Don't look down on me. You are a hated enemy, but I will never push the back of a dying person. I hope you die while apologizing to the innocent people you buried with your hands."  

　Lilithia said firmly.        
　The demon king then rolled his eyes in surprise, then said, as if satisfied, "Oh, I shall do so".

　It seemed as if he was going to disappear ......, but finally the Demon King turned to me.

"Tanaka. I was sent to ・・・・・・・・・ this world, probably by someone. I don't believe there was no reason for that action."    
"...... ！！"

　The Demon Lord said something outrageous.    
　This was important testimony. I listened intently to his words.

"I'm sure it's the same for the elf princess and the evil one. Someone did it for a purpose. Maybe that's why there are dungeons in this world."

　If dungeons are indeed from another world, there is a strong possibility that someone is the culprit.      
　It is hard to believe that there are so many people who can connect this world to the other world.

"It would be a troublesome opponent using unknown technology, but..."

　Lucifer looked me straight in the eye and said

"You will not be defeated. You can beat him without restraint."    
"Yes, I'll do that.

　The Demon King smiled and nodded in reply.      
　Finally, he looked up to the heavens and disappeared with a look of satisfaction.

　Lilicia watched the situation and turned to me.

"I thank you, Tanaka. Thanks to you, our vengeance has been fulfilled. I am sure that our people are happy. I will definitely return the favor."     
"You don't have to be so formal. I was just doing my job."    
"No, you didn't!　You defeated the Demon King, and if we don't reward you accordingly, the name of the Elves will be ruined!"

　
　Hmmm, I don't know what to do. I really don't need any thanks. I'd rather go home, take a shower, and go to bed.     
　As I was thinking that, I heard a sound like something hard falling to the ground.
　
  <div data-nat="424166"></div>

"Hmm?"

　I looked and saw a small sphere lying on the ground where the Demon King had been.     
　The sphere was gradually cracking, and after a little while, it suddenly cracked with a loud sound!　

"Ah!"

　I had a bad premonition and involuntarily mumbled something like that.     
　The next moment, the dungeon shook strongly!　The dungeon started to shake strongly. It seemed that my bad premonition had come true.

"What in the world?"    
"That was the dungeon core!　We need to get out of here as fast as we can!"

　It seems that the demon king Lucifer was set as the boss of this dungeon.     
　The core was generated in his body as a result, and when I defeated him, the core was also destroyed.

　If the core is destroyed, the dungeon will disappear. If we stayed put, we would be buried alive and well. I had to avoid that.

"Dagosuuke, can you run?"
"Well, leave it to me!　You can do it, brother!"

　Dagosuke, who was waiting a short distance away, answered cheerfully.      
　He was waiting a little further away and answered cheerfully.

"Lilicia-san, are you all right?"    
"I'm fine too......."

　Lilicia-san tried to run, but she held her leg painfully.    
　It seems that she was injured. Running wouldn't be easy.

"I'm the proud princess of the elves. This is nothing to worry about......."

　In order not to be resisted, I approached her at high speed, and when I picked her up in my arms as a princess, Lilicia-san let out a lovely scream. I'm sorry, but I don't have the luxury of choosing the means. I was forced to carry her

"What are you doing, Tanaka?"    
"I'm sorry. If you have a complaint, we'll take it up later."     
"Put me down at once....... Kya!　That was fast!"

　I was able to support Lilicia, who was turning red in the face, as we began to escape from the dungeon together with Dagosuke.
