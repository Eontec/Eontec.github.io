　 The dungeon exploration was time-consuming on the way there, but the return trip is surprisingly not difficult.     
　I know the way and the monsters didn't attack us that much. Although I was carrying a princess in my arms, we were returning home quickly and easily.

「Why are we returning so quickly?」     
「It's too fast, lol.」     
「I'm not surprised to see you running on the wall anymore.......」    
「Oh, there's a monster out there.」    
<!--more-->
「Watch out!　Shatiken's going to get you!」    
「I'm worried about the monster!」     
「Oh, he kicked it, and it took out its upper body.」     
「He's too strong, even with his arms full.」    
「Dagosuke-kun is keeping up with him.」    
「At this rate, we'll get out of here.」

"Hi, hei, I'm tired..."     
"We're almost there, Dagosuke. Hang in there."    
"Yes, yes......."

　Dagosuke replied to my words, although he was exhausted.    
　We had already crossed the underground lake where I met Dagosuke and reached the upper level. From here on, the monsters were weak and there were no obstacles.    
　　I was tired too, but I had no problem running to the surface. Lilicia-san was also in good spirits as she was held very maturely.

"I thank you...... Tanaka. I will definitely repay you for this, look forward to it."     
"It's fine. I just helped you with my work."   

　While we were on the move, Lilicia-san said she would thank me.     
　I'm getting paid by Dojima-san for the work I did on this case, so I don't need anything more than that. I'm adamant about it, but Lilicia-san won't stop saying she'll thank me.(Tl: Bro is desperately scared of owning a forest)

　Hmmm, what should I do?

"I'm saying I'll do anything for you!　Why aren't you willing!"    
"Well, if you say too much, I'll get flamed again, so if you could please be quiet......"     
"Flames?　I'm not using fire magic!"(Tl: She really doesn't know)    
"No, that's not what I meant......."

「Shachiken is flinching lol.」    
「She's flirting with you.」    
「I've spent my whole life wanting Lilicia-san to thank me.」    
「Please make a Doujinshi.」(Tl: Fan work, commonly erotic)    
「I don't care if it's a thick book.」(Tl: The literal translation for Doujinshi is  'thin book', probably because of the lenghts, this is a pun/joke, playing on that)     
「[Comiket]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comiket ) will be a great success.」    
「Wow, she's so cute.」    
「Wow!」     
「A dark horse has emerged in the heroine race.」    
「Gigi...... you're making eyes at my Tanaka .......」    
「Shachiken is about to get stabbed!」    
「Well, the knife that stabbed him will break, so he'll be fine.」    
「lmao.」

"And Tanaka. Stop using honorifics. You're the brave warrior who defeated the Demon King, there's no need to be polite to me."     
"No, but ...."     
"What are you complaining about?"

　Lilicia-san glared at me.      
　If people in this world become uncooperative, I could be the one to blame.

　She is a super important person.      
　 I can't be responsible if she becomes unfriendly to people from our world. I can't help it, so I give in.

"I understand. ...... Lilicia ・・・・. Do you have any complaints about this?"

　She smiled happily and said, "Yes, that's fine".     
　Once again, she's a hell of a beauty...... No wonder she's so popular with the comments.

「You're down (I'm sure).」    
「Oh my god, she's too cute.」     
「Too fast on the attack.」       
「I'm a member of the strategy group.」    
「My Lilithia-tan is ......」     
「Please, don't drop Dagosuke.......」    
「There's a maniac in here.」     
「I'm sure Dagosuke has been down there before.」     
「The other world looks like a dangerous place, and strong Tanaka will be popular.」       
「I think he'd be better suited to that world.」     
「Please, don't go.......」      
「If he goes, the loss will be too great.」

　A lot was said in the comments, but I didn't intend to go to another world.     
　Well, it certainly sounded like fun, but I'll be doing my best to live in this world. I have to repay those who have helped me, and I also have to manage the guild.       
　I'll think about it when it's all over.

"...... Oh, it's time to exit."    
"Really?　Yes!"

　Dagosuke is delighted at my words.    
　The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful. I've managed it this time, too.

「We did it!"    
「Welcome back, Shachiken!」    
「Good night.」    
「Good job!」     
「You were great again!」    
「[¥10000] You're the best, Shachiken!」       
「［¥1000］ I know it's not much, but we're celebrating!」     
「Welcome back!」     
「［¥2000］And we'll be waiting for Lilicia-tan's stream too.」    
「Toma.」    
「[¥3200] Another good one.」   
「Oh...」    
「Hmm, ......?」    
「Round and round.」   
「Did it stop?」    
「Wait...」    
「What?」    
「［¥200］」    
「Yes.」   
「Ah.」    
「」

"...... hmm?"

　Suddenly the comments on the feed stopped.     
　That's strange, this has never happened before.

　The magical element floating around in the dungeon also has the effect of relaying radio waves and sending them to the ground. In the first place, this place is at the top of the dungeon, so it shouldn't be impossible for the radio waves to reach the ground.

"Is there a mechanical malfunction?"

　I tilted my head.    
　It's sad that I can't stream the...... goal, but I don't have time to worry about that right now. I prioritise escape for now. But,

"Stop."

　Suddenly, the voice of a third party echoes through the dungeon, and I stop in my tracks.    
　Then, five men appeared to block our way. They are all dressed in expensive-looking suits. By the way, I don't recognise any of their faces.

"......, who are you?　I'm in a hurry."    
"We have no intention of stopping you. Our purpose is not you, Makoto Tanaka."

　The person who seemed to be the leader of the men raised his arm and pointed at the person I was holding in my arms.

"Our objective is 'her'. We will protect and manage her. This is the government's 'decision'."

　The man who had suddenly appeared said this coldly.

TL Note: I just checked my Google Search metrics, and Turns out I've finally claimed the number one result if you search, Sam's Translations. Thank y'all for for this, cuz it's all you, I didn't do any search engine optimisation on the site, so I have no one else to thank but you. ANyways, I've caught up to the raws, so no realeases unless the author releases. I'm thinking of taking up one very interesting novel I saw, but the author hasn't updated this year, and I don't know if the novel is just on a break, or if it has been dropped, I'll wait for a bith, and if there's any new releases, I'll start posting, If there's none, I'll probably still translate it to just spend time.
