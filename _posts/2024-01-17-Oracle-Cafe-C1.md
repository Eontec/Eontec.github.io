…




In this world, there exists a mysterious power called 'Heavenly Blessing'.

Everyone is equally told by an oracle when they reach the age of 15.    
It is a blessing bestowed by the only god in this world, the goddess Rona.    
It is a special skill or characteristic that no one else can possess, but only that person.     
Some people have risen through the blessings. Some have brought change to the world.      
Heavenly blessings had great significance as a possibility to move even this society.       

It seems.     
Yes, it used to be.

<!--more-->
Unfortunately, I have never seen it.      
Of course, I don't even know my own Heavenly Blessing.

In the first place, I don't even know if it still exists. I mean,     
I'm not interested. Not only me, but most of the people in the world think so.      
To put it bluntly, it's an outdated legend.


Sorry, but I'm not interested.

My name is Tran Magpot.

My family owns a long-established restaurant that's been in business for four generations. I think it's a pretty big place.      
I'm the third son, so I'm not going to take over the restaurant.
However, it seems that the blood of a chef does indeed flow through my veins.      
I've always loved making and eating my own food.

Because I'm an easy-going third son, I have my own dreams.    
It's not that big, but I'm determined. I've worked hard.

Today, I'm presenting it in front of my family. Today is the only time I can say what my dream is.      
Yes.

Today is my 19th birthday. 

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Birthday.      
It can be exciting no matter how old you are. I think it's childish of me.     
Today is the only day I get to be the star of the show. I'm not going to be weird and reserved.      
The year before last I got a bicycle as a present, but other than that it's always a treat.          
That's fine. In fact, I like it that way. I love eating and cooking.      
Besides, this year I want to make it a special year for me too.

A blessed 15th birthday?     
I don't really care about that.      
It costs a lot of money to ask an oracle, and I didn't really want to know about the blessings.    
Or, if it was a strange blessing, it would have ruined my birthday.    
I didn't go through with it, as a matter of course.    
The goal in front of me is much more important than outdated fairy tales.

Let's see.    
I overslept a bit, but I guess I can be tolerated as a birthday privilege.
Today is a public holiday. The shop is closed.

Let's get excited!

"Good morning, Tran."    
"Good morning."

.........

What is it.    
Something's not right.

What is this awkwardness in the house?    
Did I do something wrong? Was oversleeping that bad?    
No, no. My parents and brothers don't seem to be angry with me.     
It's more like they're all awkward and their eyes are swimming.

Could it be that I've got the day wrong?    
How is that possible? I'm not stupid enough to get my birthday wrong.
Yes, I'm sure. Today is 7 June. It's definitely my birthday.     
...Maybe people have forgotten? No, no. It's my day off, but I'm busy cooking.     
I've been busy cooking, there's no way I've forgotten.

I mean, why haven't they even said "happy birthday" to me?     
It's my birthday. It's an annual event for me...

............

Hmm?       
I think you're making too many dishes.     
How many people are you planning to invite? This is just...     
...it's too plain.     
For food served at a birthday party, it looks as plain as possible.      
This is rather...

Wait a minute.

I had a bad feeling in my chest.    
No way...

"Ka-san"
"Nn?"

When I saw my mother's face as she stopped, I felt a certain conviction.

"Is something wrong?"
"Yeah."

Perhaps she was waiting for me to guess what was going on.    
When she turned to face me, there was no longer any hesitation on her face.

"I got a call from the Stainys' house."     
"What of?"
"...... that Mr Lutger passed away early this morning."

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

To my own surprise, I wasn't surprised.    
Perhaps it was because I was somehow prepared for such a story.

I knew it.    
I knew that such a thing had happened.   
And that old man Rutger.     
This atmosphere in the house made sense in every sense of the word.

Rutger Stainey.

The most eccentric old man in town.     
And.


The only oracle I know.

TL Note: New Novel People!!! This wasn't the novel I planned on taking up, but the author had droped that novel, and I found this gem. This seems more relaxed than the continous fighting with the other novels, well, I haven't gone very far, So Who knows?
I've translated a bunch of chapters down, but I'll release them slowly, so I'll always have something to post. You can read the advanced chapters on my patreon if it's so important to you, or you could wait.
Click on an ad today tho, just click and go black, they would't know. I'm trying to see if I can upgrade my laptop in the middle or end of the year.

Anyways, On to Chapter 2
