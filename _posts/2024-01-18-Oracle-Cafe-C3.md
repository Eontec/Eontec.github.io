Tl: Sam


…



I really think that in life you never really know what will happen and how things will turn out.        
I feel like it's something you think about when you're 19, but you think about it, so it can't be helped.

Opening my own coffee shop. That was my dream and my goal.     
When my birthday came around, I was going to declare it clearly to my family. However,      
That's a pretty far-reaching goal. I didn't think that I would be able to realise it anytime soon, no matter how hard I tried.     
I didn't think I would be able to achieve it anytime soon.     
I had already obtained my chef's qualification last year. I've cleared that side of things.     
If I were to take over the restaurant now, I'm confident enough to run it.
<!--more-->

But I don't have anything to go on. I have almost no savings.     
Whether I rent or buy, I need to earn money to own a restaurant.      
I could work in the family restaurant or get hired somewhere else. Anyway,     
Work steadily to make a certain amount of money. Then you can actually start working.      

Then, one day, when I'm on my own, I'll propose to Nemil.     
I was going to make my first declaration on my birthday with that kind of determination.    

But Grandpa Rutger died that day.     
My family recognised me and I officially became married to Nemil.

My life had to take an unexpected fast forward.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Grandpa Stainey's house - the house where his son and his family live.     
He lived alone in a place a little to the west. That was before I was born.     
When I was a kid, I used to go to Grandpa's house with Nemil.

I didn't know it for a long time, but that house wasn't so much 'Grandpa's house' as 'the oracle's house'.     
It was more of an oracle's house. Nemil's father told me about it.     
That means the generations before Grandpa lived there for a long time.

Even though it is an empty and nominal job, the oracle is a holy profession authorised by the state.     
It is considered special in its own right, and there is an obligation to register.     
And they are not allowed to move out unless there are exceptional circumstances.    
At least in this country, the residency rules are apparently quite strict.

But on the other hand, the reality is that it is not possible to live off the oracle's work alone,     
The state is well aware of this. That's why they are free to work a second job, or even get a job if they want.     
It is also permitted to find a job. In short, all you need is the fact that you have taken over.     
Of course, as long as you live in a certain place, they don't complain if you turn it into a school or a shop.       
...It goes without saying that dubious professions are not allowed.

It means that there is consideration for those who have been forced into a barren inheritance.

I've said all that up front.     
In other words, from now on, Nemil will live in her grandfather's house. Probably for the rest of her life.     
As soon as she takes over as oracle, all the rights to the house will be transferred to Nemil. And,    
Nemil is going to marry me in the not-too-distant future.

Yes, that's right.    
This means that I got for free the 'empty property' that should be a coffee shop...     
That's what it means.


Life is really confusing.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Two days after the meeting.

Me and Nemil had come to Grandpa's house to tidy up.     
Normally it would have been the Staines family, but things had changed.     
So the two of us were left in charge of everyone else.

We two are no longer waiting.     
According to the constitution, when the previous oracle dies, the next generation is selected as soon as possible.     
Then, within three months at the latest, they must go to the capital to register as an oracle.        
Once that is done, Nemil is already obliged to live in the house.    
There is no time to relax. I'll be ready to live here by then.

And if I don't hurry up, I won't make it in time. To be honest, I'm in trouble.     
Even if it's only for a short period of time, it's out of the question to let Nemil live here alone.     
I need to turn this house into a coffee shop by that date, no matter what it takes.     
It's a big house, so it's enough to live on the second floor. The shop will only be on the ground floor.    
We will use what we have as much as possible and keep the interior renovation to a minimum.    
We will have to take things out of our shop, but we will ask for forgiveness for that.     
We'll have to ask them to give us a break, including the renovation costs, as we're paying our way up the ladder.

Fortunately, my parents and brothers are looking at this case favourably.     
I can't help but be spoilt in a number of ways. I'll pay them back little by little.

I looked up at Grandpa's house while thinking about this and suddenly felt like crying.     
I could hold it in, but it wasn't because I felt sad. And Nemil next to me.    
She had a similar expression on her face.

I don't want to say that Grandpa's death was the trigger.      
It's the same for me and Nemil. But I couldn't have been more strongly influenced by my granddad.     
I was pushed back by Grandpa.

I don't want to say that.     
This is probably the last present I will receive from Grandpa.    
Whether we can accept it as a good thing or not, it's up to us from now on.     
Watch me, Grandpa.

I'll make it happen.
