Tl: Sam


…



I didn't expect this kind of story.     
I didn't expect that Nemil was going to follow in Grandpa Rutger's footsteps.      
It was not impossible to predict, but to be honest, it was a matter that didn't even cross my mind.

"...I'm going to become an oracle?"    
"Yes."

In response to Nemil's bewildered question, her father's tone was decisive.    
This must have been decided from the beginning. There is no sign of reversal.

When was the first time...?    
When this father became an only child. The oracle master in his own generation.     
In order not to let it die out, the youngest child will be Grandpa Rutger's heir.      
That was probably decided before Nemil and I were born.     
<!--more-->
It's not something that can be overturned by saying something here and now.       
That much I realised.

Now all I have to do is...

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

"Can I do it? An oracle is a job..."      
"..............."

The father did not answer Nemil's disappearingly small words.    
After a moment of silence.

"Of course, you need to train yourself to be able to see the blessings."

The father then changed his tone with a small shrug.

"But worst case scenario, it's okay if you can't do it."     
"What?"    
"I've said it many times, but in this day and age oracles are really nothing more than names."     
"Grandpa was aware of that. To be honest, I've never seen one actually proclaim heavenly blessings either.      
I have never seen it. So even if I couldn't actually do it, that's okay.     
I will follow in Grandpa's footsteps, and have the next generation to take over the position again.      
Just know that it's our duty not to let it die out."

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Silence filled the room again.     
Nobody said anything.     
I was silent too.      
Maybe what I wanted to say was on my face. That's fine.       
But I dared to keep quiet.

She'll just take over in name only, right?     
And then have a child and have the youngest son take over the same job again? It's an empty story, no matter how far you go.      
Is being an oracle such a holy profession that you have to go to such lengths to protect it?      
Of course, I don't mean to deny the fate of hereditary succession itself. Everywhere in the world.      
I can't say. It's not something I can say anything about.

However, I don't feel comfortable with the idea that I should take over even if I can't do it.       
It's a story that will determine the future of Nemil, but there is too little substance to it.       
In a way, it's a much more unsatisfying story than having to bear a harsh fate.        
There are many things I want to say. Still, I kept my mouth shut.
It's not my turn now. But it will be my turn.

I'm sure it will be my turn.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

After a long silence.

"Tran boy."    
"Yes?"

Nemil's father called out to me and I turned to face him. then, he said.     

"I've asked you to come with your parents, of all people. We'll discuss the future..."      
"Nemil himself insisted on your presence."     
"I understand."

I didn't hesitate in my reply. It was already too late for me.

"Just to be clear, did you know that Nemil was taking over the oracle's position?"    
"Of course I didn't know."      
"Of course you didn't."

I guess it was really just a confirmation. Dad laughed a bit.      
It's no surprise he didn't know, and he really rather didn't care.

After several, short pauses.

"...So let me hear it from you. I want to know what you, or rather you and Nemil, want to do from now on,"     
"What do I want to do with Nemil from now on?"     
"Yes."

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

So we've finally reached this point.    
My parents are waiting for my next words. And Nemil, of course.

I was a little proud of myself for not being impatient or nervous.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

"I want to open my own coffee shop."

As I said this, I was feeling strangely emotional. I was sure that this was a statement I had failed to make on my birthday.       
I was a little nervous.

"It doesn't matter if it's small. I want to open a shop with Nemil."     
"Does that mean you're going to hire her?"     
"No."

I suppressed the urge to say, "You know what I mean," and answered solemnly.

"I want to get married eventually, that's the premise. That's my goal."

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

How many times will there be silence?    
At any rate, I said it without biting. I want to pat myself on the back for that.     
After I said it out, I thought I might get anxious... but surprisingly I was fine.    
The expression on Nemil's face as she sat in front of me made my anxiety disappear.

And.

"Nemil."

Dad, taking a breath, slowly asked Nemil.

"Are you okay with that?"    
"I'm not 'okay'... dad."

She said in a stronger tone than anyone had expected, and Nemil stood up.    
Then, looking around at everyone's faces, she said, with an expression of relief on her face: 

"I 'like it!!!!"

The last part was almost a shout. Everyone was a bit overwhelmed.    
But I was laughing at Nemil's situation.

"Well said, Nemil."    
"I'm sure Grandpa would be pleased."

Taking over as oracle?     
That's not important now.

My dream now that I'm 19 years old. My goal. And the wish of my childhood friend Nemil.      
In front of Grandpa's corpse, we both made a vow. We wiped away our tears and swore to each other.

This is what we call our determination.
