…



Anyway, there was a lot of stuff. That was my impression of Grandpa's house.



I didn't mean that it was a dump or anything like that. It's organized,      
It's not that it's not well cleaned. It is a house where you can feel the fact that someone lived there not so long ago.      
It's not dilapidated in the slightest.
<!--more-->

However, it is quite heavily furnished for a one-person house. There are a lot of miscellaneous things.      
From figurines that I don't know what they are used for, to tools of various shapes and sizes.      
I think it's a remnant of the fact that he used to work as a general store. Every room is filled with a jumble of things.     
To be honest, I am at a loss. Sorting through and disposing of this mass of stuff,      
And then changing the interior? I'm tempted to whine that it's out of my hands right now.


But I can't back out now.     
Now that we had made the big decision, we had no choice but to push forward to achieve our goal.      
That was our reality.



＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝



Anyway, first of all, we need to confirm what we have. Without that, we can't start anything.     
Maybe we can find grandpa's navel or inheritance.     
The whole house is Nemil's now, so we win if we find it.      
I think I'm a little shallow, but it's okay to dream about it.


While I was thinking about this and that, I was looking for something here and there.

"Hey, Tran."

Nemil, who was checking the bookshelf, spoke to me.

"What's wrong?"      
"Do you really think I can be your next oracle?"       
"............."

It was a direct question out of the blue. To be honest, it was not an easy question to answer.

I chose my words carefully.

"Do you mean, you mean a job where you actually see the blessings in the heavens?"      
"Of course I do"     
"Frankly, I think it's pretty hard."

I answered immediately. Since I was told to be honest, I didn't want to be lazy and half-hearted.    
I didn't want to make things up in half-words.

And then...

"I see...I knew it."     

Nemir was neither angry nor saddened. Nemil said this with a small wry smile on her face.     
I'm sure that was the same as mine, or perhaps more frankly, her true feelings.


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝


I'm sure she was just as honest, if not more so, than I was.      
As my father said at the time, Nemir is in the position that as long as she becomes an oracle, her achievements will not be questioned....      
She is truly an oracle in name only. Well, if you say that's fine, there is no need to go to the trouble of pursuing the matter.



But whether or not Nemir is satisfied is another story. As far as I know,      
Nemir is not the kind of person who would make such an easy choice.     
It is only natural that she would want to be a proper oracle.

Having said that, I think it would be quite difficult.


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝



The day Nemil decided to become an oracle, we were told about the oracle.      
Apparently, Grandpa had told her dad earlier for this day.        
Well, it was a minimum level of accountability.

It was more difficult than I had expected to see the blessings of man.    
First of all, you had to completely master the complicated special chanting in the ancient language.      
It seems that the chanting is in the vein of ancient magic, which is now completely something of legends.       
It is not just memorized by sound, but the meaning must also be understood before it can be activated.     
I don't know what to say, but I can't imagine Nemir being able to do it.     
Even she had a blank look in her eyes when she looked at the string of archaic words written in a bewildering manner.

Another problem is the existence of the Nerang stone, which is used as a catalyst.      
By making this resonate with the chanting, the subject's blessings would be imaged into letters.     
What a majestic process! However, there is a serious problem here.

In fact, this nerang stone can be used as a catalyst only twice at best.      
After that, it is completely used up. In short, it is almost a one-time disposable.

Moreover, this stone is expensive. Though not as expensive as gemstones or precious metals,    
It seems that the amount of mining is decreasing now, and it is not easy to get it at a low price.


It is said that there are still some deposits of the stone if you look for it,     
But there are almost no specialized miners left to mine. No wonder.     
It is a special ore that has no use other than to look at the blessings of heaven, and yet the blessings themselves are completely obsolete.      
Who would want to do such unprofitable mining?



Of course, the cost of purchasing the nerang stone used to see the blessings would have to be borne by those who wish to use it.       
If they had to bear such a burden, the oracle would go bankrupt in no time.      
That is why it costs money to see the blessings. The mechanism was surprisingly simple.

And then I thought deeply.        
Clearly, this is a story that is beyond our control.



＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝



"Anyway, there's no point in thinking about it too much right now. Let's do what we can."       
"I agree."

Apparently, she just wanted to say it out loud once.       
Nemir, smiling, showed no sign of melancholy. I smiled back and shrugged my shoulders.     
Yes, we should concentrate on opening the coffee shop for now. We'll think about the rest later.     
Anyway, let's get this house in order and then...

"What's that?"

Suddenly, Nemil, who was going through the drawers of the desk, raised a suspicious voice.

"What's wrong?"       
"Here."

Nemir picked up a small sealed envelope.      
It seemed to be enclosed with something other than paper, and you could see that it was slightly bulging.

"A letter?"       
"It looks like a letter. It has Grandpa's name on it. It's dated August of last year."

That's a long time ago.

Maybe it was a letter that he failed to send out. I'm a little curious.

"By the way, do you know who it's addressed to?"        
"Yeah."     
"Who is it?"      
"You."      
"Heh?"   
  
I made a weird sound.

"What did you say?"       
"Look."

Nemir stared at me, holding the letter with both hands and turning it to face me.

"You're sure, right?"      
".........."

There's no doubt about it. It was written in the familiar handwriting of my grandfather.

"Dear Tran Magpott," he wrote.


A letter from Grandpa, left to me?       
I had no idea what it was.        
But I was strangely certain.

I was sure it was something that would have a great impact on our future.

It was an afternoon when the birds chirping in the garden sounded strangely clear.
