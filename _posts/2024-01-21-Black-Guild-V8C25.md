Tl: Sam


…



"Are you from the government ......?'

　Hearing the words of the man who appeared, I raised my alertness to a much higher level.     
　I was not so gullible as to hand Lilithia over to him and say, "Yes, I see.

"Yes, my name is Izumi and I belong to a certain government organization. Please take care of me, Tanaka-sama."

　The smug smirk on his face. I am sure that name is also a false name.      
<!--more-->
　I don't know where to put my trust, but I think it is probably true that they are from the government.     
　If they weren't, they wouldn't be able to easily enter this government-controlled dungeon. But,

"Suppose you really are from the government, why would you want to take them in here?　I originally came to this dungeon on business for the Ministry of Magic, not by myself, I intend to have her protected by the Ministry of Monster Control."

　A princess from another world is too much for me, a working adult. I'm going to have Dojima-san and Amatsuki protect her.      
　If you're from the government, you'd know that. The fact that they are trying to take her into custody in secret like this means that they don't want me to hand her over to the Ministry of Monster Control.

"If you really want to take her into custody here, please call Dojima-san or Amatsuki from the Ministry of Monster Control. If you do so, I will believe you."     
"...Sigh. We also wanted to carry out the matter peacefully."(Tl: You want to FIGHT THE GUY THAT LITERLLY JUST DEFEATED A WORLD DESTROYER ON STREAM, surely a good idea, of course)

　As Izumi muttered that, the men quickly came forward. 
　 It seemed like they were prepared to use brute force. 

"The government is not a monolith either. There are some people who have trouble with the tepid approach of the Ministry of Monster Control. The value of "her'' is infinitely high... Her existence must be kept completely secret and out of sight of people overseas. Minister Dojima cannot give up his feelings, and now is not the time to say such naive things.'' 

　Certainly, Mr Dojima will give some freedom to those he protects. He would never do anything like confine them.     
　But there are people who would have trouble with that.

　It doesn't seem like the "front" government would take such quick and forceful measures.      
　So it's not like the Prime Minister or something, it's a master-boss, a power that doesn't appear in the public eye. I'm sure that these guys in front of me are also an organisation that is supposed to not exist".

　Come to think of it, I have heard from Dojima-san that there are organisations in Japan that undertake dirty work that is not known to the public, like the secret police. These guys are probably like that.     
　I don't know how they would treat Lilicia if I handed her over to them. I can't give her to them.

　I drop Lilithia from my arms and let her fall back.

"They're dangerous. You need to stay back a little bit."     
Okay, okay. I trust Tanaka."

　Lilicia looked confused, but she said so and did as I said.     
　It seemed that she trusts me. That's very helpful in this situation.

　The self-proclaimed fifty-something resident saw this and twitched his eyebrows.

"Are you sure ......?　Our power is greater than you think... I don't think it will end well."     
"No, no, no!　You can say whatever you like!　We're not tools!"

　Then suddenly Dagosuke, who had remained silent until now, interrupted.      
　It seemed that he could no longer stand the other party's rude language.

"Deep One, the otherworldly fisherman. You are of course a target to be secured. You're less important than the elf princess, though. You will come with us and tell us all about it."    
"Who the hell are you with!"

　Dagosuuke said with authority, but he was a little scared.

　What should we do now?     
　 If the exit was blocked, it would be difficult to escape with the two of them in my arms.

　In that case, it seems like we have no choice but to fight and resist, but is it okay to defeat the government people? It is true that they have great power. I don't know if even Mr. Dojima can protect me. 

　As I was thinking this, Izumi gave a signal and one of his men came towards us.      
　And as he attempted to grab Lilicia's arm, I reflexively grabbed his hand and stopped him. After all, I couldn't just sit back and let it happen.

"Tell me one thing. Will their human rights be guaranteed?"     
"I can guarantee their safety, but nothing more. They are not of this world, so they have no human rights."(Tl: That honestly sounds like something a shady government organization woul say)

　The man said, disinterestedly.     
　With these words, my mind was made up. I swung my arm and slammed the man to the ground.

"Gaah ......!?"

　He must have been an awakened person. The man's body was sturdy, but the impact was unbearable and he lost consciousness with a jerk.      
　Izumi, who had been watching the series of actions, twitched her eyebrows. Apparently, he was a little upset.

"Is it safe to assume that negotiations have broken down? I don't think it's a wise choice." 

　Izumi looked at his fallen subordinate and asked, with a hint of grumpiness.    
　He probably didn't expect me to resist. It's true that if I was a social slave, I would never have rebelled against my superiors. However, 

"I'm sorry, but I stopped when I left the company workforce. I don't obey authority without a fight."(Tl: He's in hhis rebellious phase people)

　I replied, and went on to my last job of the day.
