Tl: Sam


…




There was a bit of a back-and-forth, but then things got serious indeed.    
As expected, the second page of the letter seemed to be entirely an explanation of the ring.      
Both Nemil and I changed our minds and adjusted our posture.

Now, come on, don't be afraid.
<!--more-->

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

『You already know that you need a special chant in an ancient language to see the blessings.』

Oh, this assumes we've already had an explanation from her father. That's a very deep reading.
It's frustrating, but I still think it's great.

『But it's not easy to learn that one. I've made an abbreviated version of that chant and carved it into the inside of the ring. If you look closely, you can see it, can't you? 』     
"Eeh?"

Nemil, who shouted in surprise, held up the ring and stared more intently at the inside.      
I looked at it too, but it only looks like a fine pattern. This,    
Are you telling me that this is the string of that ancient language...?     

『It took me eight years to carve it perfectly. It was quite a task. 』     
"............"

We just looked at each other. Should I just say thank you for your hard work?    Frankly, it seemed like madness.
I mean, I somehow understood why the letters were so small.     
If I i had been doing this for eight years, my normal letters would get smaller too.     
And?

『This way, when I put the ring on, I don't have to chant. Of course, you can't use it on anyone but Nemil.』    
"Oh, I don't have to remember all that? Yes!"

Nemil is happy. Oh, come on, you're being a bit generous.    
...Well, maybe it's an old man's prerogative to have a soft spot for his grandchildren.      
With a wry smile, I continue reading.

『What's embedded in the stone is a pure crystal of Nerang stone. As it contains no impurities.     
The number of times it can be used before transformation is an order of magnitude higher than normal. I took some rough measurements,
It can probably be used around 100,000 times. ............... Seriously?』     
"100,000 times? ... you mean we get to see 100,000 blessings for free?"

Nemil's eyes changed colour. Maybe it's the same for me.

The main reason why it costs money to see Heavenly Blessings is that Nerang stones are expensive.      
Moreover, they are disposable, so they are really inefficient. No wonder they've gone out of business.      
In today's world, how many people really get heavenly blessings per year?

But if this ring is as good as it says it is, then there is almost no need to pay for it.      
But that doesn't mean we'll look at it for free.     
If we did, we would be bashed by oracles all over the world.

That's why we're going to set the price a little bit low. You don't have to be rich to afford it.       
If we keep it affordable, there will be some people who are interested.     
After all, you don't need any original capital. It would be a great opportunity to make money! 

"...nuh-uh-uh-uh."

Unexpectedly, we both burst into eerie laughter at the same time.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Let's get on with it. We'll move on to the practical part right away. What is it...?

『Here's how to use it. First, Nemil puts the ring on. You can put it on any finger.     
But it must be worn on the left hand』    
"Yes, yes!"

Nemir put the ring on the ring finger of her left hand, with high tension. It fit perfectly.   

『And focus your attention on a specific person. That way, the first
signs appear in the vision.』     
"Look and concentrate? Um..."

It's obvious, but the subject is me. The eyes that stare at me are slightly scary.    
...Nn?

"Oh, something about Tran's whole body is starting to glow white."    
"No, your eyes are glowing a little too."     
"Really?"

As soon as I said that, the luminescence of her eyes disappeared. She must have lost her concentration.      
The important thing is that the ring itself is unmistakably real.    
...Finally, a hint of a money-making scheme is approaching.
Oops, we continue.

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

『When you see a sign, you have to concentrate on that person even more.
This is all about feeling. It's hard to explain, so just try it.』

That's really a sensory expression. Well, if you think about remembering that difficult chanting...     
It's a very easy and thorough process. This time, Nemir is not in a hurry and intends to listen to the explanation until the end.     


『The subject's 'blessings' are now formed in the form of letters. At this stage.     
Nemil is the only one who can see them, so read them out loud to him and pronounce them.    
Then the letters will appear in a form that everyone can read and they will dwell in the person. The proclamation of the Heavenly Blessing.     
This is the end. ......... it's really easy.』

I was just being frank. Can this really be done?    
Nemir also seemed to be half-convinced. But all we have to do now is try it out.     
Yes, you just have to actually see the 'blessings'...     
Of course, I know the person She'll try it on.

It's me.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

"Well, then, I'll give it a try."

The first time I saw Nemil, I was a little nervous from the sight of her checking the ring.

I was 15 years old when I received my blessing. In other words, it was four years ago.      
I've never thought about it. I thought I would end my life without knowing.    
I never thought that Nemil, of all people, would see it. Life is a series of unexpected events.     
Life is a series of unexpected things. To be honest, there is a part of me that is a little excited.

The same pale light begins to shine in Nemil's eyes as before.

"It'll be great if I can get some cooking skills.  I'll be counting on you."     
"No, no, it's not up to me to decide or choose, is it?"    
"I'm just saying."

In the meantime, the light in Nemil's eyes became smaller and clearer.     
I don't know, but I'm sure that at this moment, in Nemil's vision, 'Heavenly blessings' are being formed as letters.    
Now, what kind of blessing would I get?

..............................

What is it?    
Why are you silent?      
I mean, what's that look on your face?
Didn't you see it?   
Did you see it?    
I don't know.
  
I can tell even if I don't want to.    
Nemil had a look of bewilderment on his face that couldn't have been more obvious.

"What's the matter?"    
'......'
"Tell me if you can see it."    
"...yeah... but... this is..."     
"No, tell me!"    

You're going to make me anxious.     
If you are silent with a face like that! 

"I've come this far. I'll be fine. So tell me, Nemil!"     
"...um...yes."

With a light in her eyes, Nemil nodded to me. For the first time since I saw her, I was so excited,     
I too, make up my mind.     
It's a once-in-a-lifetime blessing. I listen solemnly. Come on, come on!

"...Tran Magpot. Your blessing is..."

What is it?

"...is the 【Demon King】."

...................................

Huh?


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝


With a faint, high-pitched sound, light filled the room. Right in front of my eyes, shining white letters     
It was clearly drawn out.

It was indeed "Demon King".

Before I could say anything, the letter, which had lost its shape, hit my body and scattered.      
Nothing more happened. The light in Nemil's eyes had also disappeared.

".................."     
".................."    

I couldn't find the words to say.    
Neither I nor Nemil.

The ring was successfully triggered by the same procedure as Grandpa had said. Probably,      
Just as Grandpa had envisaged.

But.     
What is it?      
What's a demon king?

Without knowing what was going on, we just sat facing each other.


The silence outside the window was deafening at this moment.
