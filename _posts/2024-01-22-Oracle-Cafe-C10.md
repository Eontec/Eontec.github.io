…




The following afternoon.

"It's finally taking shape."    
"I'm hungry!"

Me and Nemil were laying side by side in the garden of Grandpa's house, stretching wide.       

After yesterday's Demon King fiasco, the two of us split up for the time being. But,     
I don't intend to throw myself out of the house. We said we'd go home and settle down.      
We thought that after a night, we would be able to get our heads out of the clouds a bit.
<!--more-->

It was another fine day.      
Fortunately, I didn't grow any horns or wings. There was no sign of any evil feelings.      
I didn't see any signs of evil feelings rising up. I was still me.

For the time being, we shelved the question of blessings and rings.      
The results were so nonsensical that my trust in Grandpa's letter dropped considerably.     
I wondered if maybe I was being pranked again.      
I don't doubt everything, but I don't have any reason to believe it.       
So, first of all, I decided to make some progress with the preparations for the coffee shop.

But it's depressing when all you do is sort out the house. I'm afraid something strange will come out of somewhere again...      
Above all, the end is not in sight.

So, I changed my mind a bit.        
Grandpa was a hardworking man, so the garden was well looked after.
There was even a flowerbed, if you wanted. Let's make good use of it! The idea came to me.     
A so-called open café. There are big paving stones, so we could set up a big table and chairs from the living room.     
We both struggled to get a big table and chairs out of the living room and put them there. It turned out better than we expected.     
We put another smaller table in a different place.     
There isn't a lot of traffic, so it seems possible to run a coffee shop in this format.

Of course, there is the issue of the scale being too small. What if it rains?     
It is true that there are too many problems to list.     
But I don't like the idea of not moving because of that. Just do it anyway.    
We'll think about the problems later. Finding the good points is an important first step.

Anyway, do what you can for now.


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝


"It's late, but let's have lunch."     
"I've been waiting for you!"

Nemil sat down on a chair and silently urged with a flapping of her hands.    
It seems that she has no intention of helping. Well, you've worked hard enough today.      
I'll at least make the tea. I made a pile of sandwiches for lunch.

Soon after, it was time for a late lunch. As expected, I didn't say anything, I just ate.     
Compared to yesterday, when I was rummaging around in my room, this is a considerable improvement. At any rate      
I was able to create a place that looked like an open café. Objectively speaking, it looks good.

"...well, first of all, it's like this..."     
"Yes, that's right."

We finally took a breather and talked deeply with each other while sipping our second cup of tea. What is it?      
I feel like we're becoming like a mature couple. It's too soon for any reason.

But that is undeniably the truth.          
This is about all we can do. In the end, we have to go ahead with it with someone else's help. In that sense     
The direction is becoming clear. Anyway, let's not get greedy, let's first give it shape.      
We can think about taking over the oracle business after that.

"Since it's not a restaurant, the kitchen will be sufficient as it is now."    
"But is it easy to use?"    
"Well, it might need some work, but we can manage."     
"If possible, I'd like to do what I can before we open."      
"I'm going to have to ask a lot of my brothers. I'll just have to make do with what I can."     
"As expected of a 19-year-old. You're very mature."     
"You'll be 19 soon, you know."

Nemir, who said this in a teasing way, laughs. As always, I coudnt see the image of her becoming a priest at all.

...Is Grandpa's ring really as good as the letter said it was?      
Is my heavenly blessing really a 'demon king'?

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

While I'm physically working, I don't have to think about these things every single time.      
But when I slow down like this, I can't help thinking about this and that.     
I don't want to think that Grandpa is lying. Nemil is the same.      
As expected, I'm no longer thinking about making money like I did yesterday,       
If the ring is genuine, I want her to take over the job of oracle master.       
That's what Grandpa would have wanted. After all, he certainly went to a lot of trouble to make it.

Right now, we're groping our way through everything.      
I want at least one thing that is certain.

Is that an extravagant wish?

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

When I was thinking vaguely that it was time to resume work.

"Nn?"

I heard an unfamiliar engine noise. And it seems to be approaching.      
That's unusual, someone coming to a place like this in a car?

"What is it?"     
"Isn't it something you ordered?"     
"I didn't hear anything about that."    

While we were exchanging words, the owner of the engine noise appeared on the street. …What can I say? While they were talking, the owner of the engine noise appeared in the street. 'How should I put it?
At first glance, you can tell it's a luxury car. People who drive such cars are either aristocrats or rich people.
In any case, it's none of our business...

Boom!

The luxury car stopped right in front of our house.    
What?     
What the hell is that?      

Before we could complete our lines of thought, the door on our side opens. The person who got out of the car was a well-dressed middle-aged gentleman, who was also very well suited to the car.     
He looked up at the house and then at us.

...Apparently, he had come here for a reason.


I clenched my folded hands together with a tightening sensation throughout my body.
