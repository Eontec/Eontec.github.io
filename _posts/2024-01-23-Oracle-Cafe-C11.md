…



I have a vain imagination. And sometimes I can be very pessimistic.     
That's exactly what I was thinking right now.


Who is this guy? I mean, what's he doing here?     
Is it possible that he's a land grabber?      
Did he find out about the ring of Nemil?
<!--more-->

Don't tell me he found out that my blessing is the Demon King and is blackmailing me...

"Excuse me."

While we were thinking about this and that, the gentleman approached us.

"This is Rutger Stainey's house, isn't it?"      
"Ah, yes.... uh, ......."



Nemil, who answered, was at a loss to say anything there. But the gentleman nodded his head.

"I know he passed away. I wanted to be there for the funeral, but I couldn't get out of work. I'm sorry I'm late."      
"No, no, of course not!"



I was a little stunned at my own stupidity as I rushed to my feet.         
I had a lot of weird imaginations, but I was missing a crucial assumption.

This person is a mourner.


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝


Anyway, I asked him to come into the yard.     
I can't ask him to enter the house now.... I'm so glad we made an open cafe, even if it's just a formality,

I cleared off the tables and brought out additional chairs. Nemil was still in the car with a woman who appeared to be the driver.     
I heard she was adamant about it,

She was in her twenties, with a very good posture, probably doubling as a bodyguard.

She said, "No, thank you, I'm fine."


I guess it was unacceptable for her to be in the same room with her husband. So we sat down at a small table that had been set out next to us.     
We added a chair to the small table next to ours and urged her to sit there.      
I didn't even give her time to think about it.

"I'm sorry, this is all we have at the moment..."

Anyway, I made a fresh pot of tea and served it to them. I had made and brought some scones,      
The scones I had made and brought as a snack turned out to be for the guests.

"Thank you, You can have some too, Noda. Let's take a break."     
"Yes, then, I'll have one without hesitation."



They probably drove from far away in a great hurry to get here.      
I was impressed by their attitude of putting off self-introductions until later.

"This...was brewed by you?"      
"What? Yes, as you can see."



The gentleman who sipped the tea turned around and asked with a surprised face.      
I made it right in front of him, so I didn't need to tell you, I answered immediately. 

"It's quite excellent, isn't it? I don't mean to be rude, but what is your family business?"      
”I run a restaurant.”      
”I see..."

On the other side of the gentleman who nodded his head in understanding, the woman who was the driver, who was called Noda, moseyed over to the second piece.      
She is munching on her second scone. She seemed to like it.     
She looked at me and rushed to correct her posture, but there was a piece of scone on the edge of her mouth.      
I saw a piece of scone on the edge of her mouth. I pretended not to notice, but I was a little happy.

I still don't know how it happened, but I'm happy to say I made my first customer reasonably happy.    


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝


"I'm sorry I'm late to the event."


The gentleman took his place opposite me and Nemil.


"My name is Torinus Sandova. and I am was taken care of by Rutger-san a long time ago."    
"My name is Tran Magpot. I was also taken care of by Rutger-san."        
"Nice to meet you. My name is Nemil Steiny."

The gentleman who introduced himself as Torinus looked at Nemil with wide eyes.    

"Stainey? you are his grandchild?"    
"Yes, I am."      
"Well, that's...I'm very sorry for your loss."     
"Thank you for coming all this way for my grandfather."

Nemir, who answered firmly, was still a little teary-eyed.      
It's sad, but it's also good to be able to welcome people who come to offer condolences in this way.        
It is a good way to mourn. I'm sure Grandpa would have been happy to see them.

The afternoon sun was pleasant.



＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝



"By the way, Tran-san, Nemil-san, I just wanted to ask you something."     
"Okay."



I answered with my back straightened, and I had a kind of premonition.

"You know, of course, that Mr. Rutger was an oracle, don't you?"     
"Yes."      
"We've known that for a long time."

It's not something I'm going to say, but I don't think it's surprising that he knows.     
The fact that he was an oracle is widely known.

"I see."

Torinus-san trailed off a little there. He must be thinking about something.    
We waited in silence.      
After a while, Mr. Torinus said.

"I am going to ask you a somewhat intrusive question, but I was wondering if you would be the one to take over Rutger-san's oracle work? Nemil-san?"      
"Yes."

Nemil answered without hesitation. Torinus-san, on the other hand, looked at both of us

I couldn't help but think that it was quite rude.      
What we are doing here is authorized, at least for Stainey's family. There is no reason for anyone else to question what we are doing here.      
I had no right to be told what to do by others. And this is a man I know nothing about, except that he was once under the care of my grandfather.

Even so, I had a feeling of certainty.     
Perhaps Nemil felt the same way.

I knew that the most important thing right now was to talk to this person.
