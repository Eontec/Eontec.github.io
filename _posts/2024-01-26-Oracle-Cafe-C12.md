Torinus’ Blessing


Tl: Sam


…



As for the blessing of being a "Demon King",      
Although I don't know the full story, I don't want people to know about it.     
This is not a matter of logic.

However, I can't keep Nemil's ring that my grandfather left me a secret.     
If she is going to use it to do the oracle's work, there is no way I can cheat.    
I have no choice but to tell the truth.     
<!--more-->
Fortunately, we live in an age when natural blessings have fallen into disuse. You don't even have to worry about business enemies.      
Even if we earn money, it will be very little.      
After all, it was only a matter of time before they would reveal the truth....

So we explained the current situation to Torinus-san. The two of us.
What kind of relationship we have, how Nemil came to take over as oracle master.    
And what we are going to do with this house.

By talking to others, we felt we were able to reaffirm our current situation.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝
"I understand what's going on...it was all very sudden."      
"To be honest, it really was."

To Torinus-san, who nodded, I returned the words with a real feeling. Noda, too.     
She was glancing at me, though she did not lose her composure.     
I could understand her curiosity more clearly than I had expected.

"I was surprised that the job of an oracle is so out of the ordinary. It's a bit of a stretch to ask people to take over even if they can't do it."     
"When I heard that, I wondered what I should do in a different sense."

Nemil also responded in the same way. I don't know how to put it, but Torinus-san is a person who makes me want to talk to him.     
Not only is he a good listener, but he also has a very unique atmosphere.     
I wonder what kind of relationship this person had with grandpa.

The shadows shifted a bit.     
Before I knew it, A long while had passed.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

"Okay, then."

Could it be that they are going home?      
As I thought so, Torinus-san said to Nemil, who was sitting in front of me.

"Since we're here, shall we have you take a look at my blessings here?"    
"...Huh?"    
"If you inherited Mr. Rutger's memento, you should be able to do it."    
"No, that's..."    
"Of course I will pay you. Don't worry about that."   

That wass not what I was reffering to. But the atmosphere made me feel as if I could not say it.      
If you are an oracle, you should not treat this request lightly.       
As long as we're prepared to live here, Nemir will have to do it sooner or later.     
We have no choice but to do it now.

"I understand."

Nemil seems to have come to her senses. It was reassuring to know that they shared the same feelings.     
Stay strong, Nemil.

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Nemil slipped the ring she had been wearing around her neck through the string from her collar and put it on the ring finger of her left hand without hesitation.     

"Then let's begin."

Nemir's nervousness was evident in her voice, but her demeanor was composed.       
I focused my attention on Torinus-san. Noda-san was also looking at me intently.

As I watched on, I felt a little frustrated at my helplessness.      
This is something only Nemil can do. I am not allowed to interfere in any way.        
I can't say anything for sure about the truth or falsehood of this at this very moment.      
All I can do is to trust Grandpa and Nemil. That's all I can do.       
Please, please, please.

A long time, more than ten seconds passed.

.....................

What's the matter, Nemil?     
Don't tell me there's another Demon Lord out there? If so, then the ring is definitely fake.     
Or are you blind to what's going on? Or maybe a worse blessing in disguise...

As usual, my pessimistic imagination is expanding. And then Nemil muttered.

"It's different from the last time..."    
"What's different?"    
"The letters..."

Nemil turns to me and tells me with a puzzled look on his face, 

"They look red."    
"What?"

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

Nemil's eyes, looking at me, also have a different red glow. What is it?
Is it that even the circumstances under which it manifests are different from mine? Why in the world...?

"You can see the letters, can't you?"

Torinus-san said surprisingly calmly to us, as we were getting nervous.

"Yes, yes..."    
"If so, that's fine with me. Please say it as it is."    
"Are you sure?"    
"Of course. Go ahead."   

Nemir turned around. It seems that he has decided to go ahead. Well, then,       
I'll stop worrying, too.

After a moment of silence.

"Torinus Sandova-san."

Nemil said in a calm voice.


"Your gift is [architecture]."

＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

.........................................

Silence.     
Silence.      
An unbearable pause.

Various thoughts run through my head.   

Architecture?     
Compared to me, you're so realistic.     
I mean, why doesn't that luminous effect happen?    
Why aren't the letters forming?     
What's different from my time?

What's going on?

"What is that ......?"

Nemil mutters in a muffled voice. I'm sure she's even more confused than I am.      
But what can I say? I don't know what to say.

"Well done."     
"Eh?"    
"Hah?

We all screamed like idiots at Torinus-san's unexpected words.    
What do you mean, "well done"?

"There's no doubt about it, [architecture]. That's my blessing."     
"What do you mean?"

Torinus-san, who looked at us again, had a happy smile on his face.

"If you felt any discomfort, it was probably because I already knew about my blessings."     
"You knew...?"

In the middle of my questioning, I suddenly hit upon a possibility.      
I didn't think...

"Yes, probably just as you imagined."

He must have guessed it from the expression on my face. The words he said in a tone of voice as if he could see right through me,      
I was right.


"Thirty years ago, I received a proclamation of blessing from Rutger-san."
