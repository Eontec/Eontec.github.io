Hello everyone,

Or whoever still looks at this site. I have ij fact, nit dropped any novel.       
I have been a bit busy tge past few weeks, and unfortunstely, my laptop SSD crashed along side everything that was in it.

The good news?     
I have a spare hard drive with windows installed, so all is well? maybe?     
No, and that brings us to the bad news(Yes, my SSD failing isn't the bad news)     
My laptop has a power issue in the motherboard.     
I'm going to look around for any repair shop that works on motherboards, else, I'll have to wait a while for a replacement.     

Wish me luck or something.
