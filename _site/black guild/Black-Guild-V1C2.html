<p>TL: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Yo, heh” (TL: breath sounds ig?)</p>

<p>　I run lightly through the dungeon.</p>

<p>　Dungeons are roughly divided into upper, middle, lower, and deep layers, but what I’m aiming for right now is the deepest layer, the “deep layer.”
<!--more-->
　Normally, it’s a theory to go down little by little, but I don’t have time for that right now. So I decided to go deep into the depths at once.</p>

<p>“Haa… I’m depressed. Sometimes I want to go home and sleep peacefully. I want to eat something warm…”</p>

<p>　I continue on the way, complaining to no one in particular.</p>

<p>　The video is taken, but the president doesn’t see such a moving scene. This much should be allowed.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get a pay raise, but I’m sick of all the dangerous work… I wish I could get two hours of sleep today…”</p>

<p>「I normally wouldn’t care, but the black guild is too much, I can’t even laugh.」</p>

<p>「Live strong」</p>

<p>「I mean, isn’t the Black Dog Guild crazy? They’re ignoring the Employment Law for Explorers.」</p>

<p>「I have to record it.」</p>

<p>「I mean, the number of viewers has increased. At first there were 3, but now there are 20.」</p>

<p>「Now, there’s like 10,000 people lol」</p>

<p>“… this phone is amazing”</p>

<p>　When the smartphone shakes, it vibrates and does not stop.</p>

<p>　I don’t see the screen, but it’s probably from most companies. This phone only contains business contacts and contacts of a few old friends.</p>

<p>　I don’t do anything like SNS, and I don’t think I’ll be notified of that.</p>

<p>“Now then. Shall we go to the depths?”</p>

<p>　The central part of the Shibuya underground dungeon is a large atrium…  So if you jump down that big hole, you can go to the depths at once.</p>

<p>　I reached the atrium and jumped down from there.</p>

<p>　Of course, there are few explorers who do it because it’s a dangerous act. Even I wouldn’t do this if I wasn’t given a stupid quota.</p>

<p>「Gyaaaaaaa! he fell!」</p>

<p>「A suicide stream!」</p>

<p>「He’ll Die! Scary!」</p>

<p>「What are you doing!!」</p>

<p>“……hmmm?”</p>

<p>　The smartphone shakes again.</p>

<p>　I tilt my head while falling headlong.</p>

<p>“The phone calls are persistent today. Something may have happened, but I’m busy right now, so I’ll ignore it.”</p>

<p>　With that in mind, I ignore the vibration of my smartphone.</p>

<p>　Well, the drone that is filming is… well, it’s following me. I’m still not used to being photographed, but I can’t help it because it’s a rule.</p>

<p>　I’m so nervous even for company records, so how embarrassing would it be if I actually distributed it? If you think about it, the distributor is amazing. If I do it, will I get any comments?</p>

<p>「Uwaaaaaaaa!! How much will he fall!」</p>

<p>「This is a great video, it’s a valuable record.」</p>

<p>「I came from the bulletin board, what’s happening?」</p>

<p>「Shibuya Dungeon, Accidentally streaming, Falling」</p>

<p>「I think I understand」</p>

<p>　As I was thinking about it, the ground was getting closer and closer.</p>

<p>　Well, it’s about time to prepare for landing…as I was thinking, a big shadow approached me.</p>

<p>『Gaaaaaaaa! ! 』</p>

<p>　Flying towards me with a roar was a flying dragon with red scales, Red Wyvern.</p>

<p>　I’m pretty sure this is a monster from the lower layer. It seems like it thought I was food and flew away.</p>

<p>「What is that monster!?」</p>

<p>「That’s a wyvern! It’s quite troublesome, even an A-class explorer will have a tough time!」</p>

<p>「Ah. It’s over.」</p>

<p>「It looks like it would hurt to be bitten by those fangs…」</p>

<p>『Gyaah! 』</p>

<p>　The Red Wyvern opens its big mouth and attacks me to bite me.</p>

<p>　When I adjust my posture in the air, I grasp the sword attached to my waist.</p>

<p>　And then pull it to the last minute… pull out the sword at once.</p>

<p>“Ho”</p>

<p>　The sword flash runs and the movement of the Red Wyvern stops.</p>

<p>　Then, the next moment, the body of the Red Wyvern is cut in two, and fresh blood is scattered around.</p>

<p>“Fu, this is fine”</p>

<p>　After defeating the intruder, I suddenly land on the ground.</p>

<p>　I feel a heavy weight on my feet because I fell from a high place, but at this level it’s nothing.</p>

<p>「…Huh?! What happened!?」</p>

<p>「The Red Wyvern split in half on its own!?」</p>

<p>「You were holding a sword, but you weren’t swinging it!? What’s that?!」</p>

<p>「…Maybe it’s so fast that the camera’s frame rate can’t keep up?」</p>

<p>「Is there such a stupid story! I’ve never heard of it!」</p>

<p>「No, Red Wyvern is the same, but why is this person landing normally? Didn’t he fall nearly 1000 meters?」</p>

<p>「This is getting interesting」</p>

<p>「There are too many cohabitants. It’s already 50,000 people.」</p>

<p>「Because it’s going viral on social media. It’s already a festival.」</p>

<p>“… My smartphone is noisy. How many times are you calling me?”</p>

<p>　I take my mind off the constantly trembling smartphone and look ahead.</p>

<p>　This is the depths of the dungeon. It’s a dangerous area where dangerous monsters run rampant. You have to brace yourself.</p>

<p>“… uh, let’s go out right away.”</p>

<p>　When I looked up, many monsters appeared in front of me.</p>

<p>　Minotaur to Ogre, Death Knight to Basilisk. They are all dangerous monsters.</p>

<p>『Lulu……』</p>

<p>　Behind them is a giant dragon with brown scales, the “Tyrant Dragon”. He’s tough, so he doesn’t want to fight, right?</p>

<p>“Now, it’s time for business…! ”</p>

<p>　I held the sword firmly in my right hand and plunged into the crowd of monsters.</p>

<p>…</p>
