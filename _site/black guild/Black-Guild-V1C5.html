<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Wow, …… There’s so much buzz about it……”</p>

<p>The day after the streaming incident.</p>

<p>　I woke up in my chair at work as usual and muttered to myself while watching social networking sites and online news.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　The headlines on the Internet news were as follows.</p>

<p>The headlines read: 『Mysterious Searcher Appears to Solo the Deep End!』</p>

<p>『The corporate sword saint solo defeats the S-class monster Tyrant Dragon.』</p>

<p>『The first stream of the event reached 100 million users. Should he apply for Guinness World Records?』</p>

<p>『The Black Dog Guild, violating the Labor Standards Act?』</p>

<p>『Experts say whether the controversial video was faked or not.』</p>

<p>And social media,</p>

<p>「That guy is too strong!　Why hasn’t this been mentioned before?」</p>

<p>「Black Dog Guild, he hid something like that? No wonder he gets so many government jobs.」</p>

<p>「It feels like he’s a corporate slave to me …… his eyes looked dead」</p>

<p>「Too many people are getting caught. If you can’t tell a lie from a lie, you shouldn’t be on the internet.」</p>

<p>「That was really cool!　Does anyone know how to contact him?」</p>

<p>「I normally want to scout him for our guild, but where do I contact him: ……」</p>

<p>「Why don’t you quit the Black Dog Guild? I could definitely get into a higher-paying place.」</p>

<p>　I was the topic of conversation everywhere.</p>

<p>　I guess this is what is called “buzz”. I was not familiar with such things, having spent my days immersed in work. I wanted to get an opinion from someone who was familiar with the Internet.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m probably the only crazy person who dives into the deep end solo, but is …… really something to talk so much about?”</p>

<p>　I nod my head.</p>

<p>　It’s true that I only dive solo these days, so I don’t really know the level of other explorers.</p>

<p>　I started diving right after the dungeon was born in the world, so I thought I was a fairly strong person, but… I wonder if it’s enough to cause such a fuss..</p>

<p>“The first thing that comes to mind is that I’m a dull-looking salaryman.　I’m in a suit and I look like a normal office worker. I have dark circles in my eyes, and I don’t really look like an explorer.”</p>

<p>　That’s why people are fussing over that gap.</p>

<p>　Just as I’m convinced of that, my phone vibrates.</p>

<p>“Heyyy！？”</p>

<p>　I jump up on the spot in surprise and involuntarily stick to the ceiling.</p>

<p>　Because of what happened yesterday, I was terrified by the vibration of my phone. I won’t forget that notification-ridden experience for a while. ……</p>

<p>　I’ve already disconnected from D-tube, so it shouldn’t happen again.</p>

<p>“What now?　Um, hmm?”</p>

<p>　I climbed down from the ceiling and checked my phone, where it read, “Mitsuru Adachi, incoming call.”</p>

<p>　Adachi is one of my few friends. We used to hang out a lot, but I haven’t seen him at all lately. The truth is that I’ve been so busy that I’ve forgotten he even exists.</p>

<p>　The reason he called me at this time is no doubt related to yesterday. To be honest, I don’t really want to talk about it, but it’s also true that the only person I can talk to is Adachi.</p>

<p>　After a little hesitation, I press the call icon.</p>

<p>“Hello……”</p>

<p>“Tanaka!　I saw your stream yesterday!　hehehehe!　I was laughing throughout!　How are you feeling right now?”</p>

<p>“I’m hanging up.”</p>

<p>　I hang up.</p>

<p>　Well, let’s get ready for the first day of work. Just as I put my phone back down on my desk, the ringtone rings again. I sigh and pick up the phone again.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sorry!　I won’t mess with you anymore, so don’t hang up on me. …… pfft.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to get hung up on again?”</p>

<p>I say threateningly, and Adachi apologizes profusely, trying somehow not to get cut off.</p>

<p>“You totally haven’t changed a bit, have you?”</p>

<p>“I understand, I won’t hang up on you. You’re a hard man to deal with, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>　To be honest, I’d like to borrow Adachi’s wisdom right now. Cutting off the call won’t be good for me either.</p>

<p>　Adachi is a good talker and has a wide circle of friends. And I’m sure he knows a lot about social networking sites. Adachi should be able to come up with a way to deal with this situation.</p>

<p>　Adachi thanked me for not hanging up on him and quickly cut to the chase.</p>

<p>“I saw the video. You’re as strong as ever. I think you’re even more polished than before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need the pleasantries. What do you think I should do?”</p>

<p>” ‘What do you think I should do?’ What do you want to do first?”</p>

<p>　I’m troubled by Adachi asking me the opposite question.</p>

<p>　Well, let’s see. ……</p>

<p>“I want to delete all the videos that are circulating.”</p>

<p>“That’s impossible.”</p>

<p>　Adachi laughs at my wish. That’s terrible.</p>

<p>“The number of your Warriors clipping videos is not 100 or 200, you know.　Besides, they’ve already spread overseas. There is a real SAMURAI in Japan! ……. It’s already been translated into five languages when I checked. Give it up.”</p>

<p>“…… I didn’t know that was going to happen.</p>

<p>　I thought that if it was only in Japan, I could manage it, but I didn’t realize that it went overseas as well.</p>

<p>　Come to think of it, when I was streaming it, it had comments that looked like they were from overseas. ……</p>
