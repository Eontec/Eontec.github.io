<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“You! I hope you understand what you have done wrong ……!”</p>

<p>　Suda, the president of the Black Dog Guild, approaches me with an ogre-like expression on his face.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　I should have been prepared for this, but when I hear his voice, my stomach starts to hurt. It seems that my mind was more fragile than I thought.</p>

<p>　I’ve been listening to him for so many years that I’m completely ingrained in his corporate guts.</p>

<p>　Thanks to the conversation I had with Adachi earlier, I can now look at myself objectively. If I hadn’t talked to him, I might have surrendered at this point.</p>

<p>“Because of that stream, the company’s reputation is in ruins!　How are you going to take responsibility for that!”</p>

<p>　Suda yelled at me, his face turning red.</p>

<p>　This is an everyday occurrence in our guild. He has no great managerial skills, but he is very good at using fear to control his employees.</p>

<p>　He has a great talent for running a black company. It’s ruined my body and soul. I owe him a debt of gratitude, but if I don’t …… continue like this, I’m doomed.</p>

<p>　I want to live for myself from now on.</p>

<p>“… Other employees will come soon.  Then I’ll beat you down. Prepare yourself.”</p>

<p>　Suda smiled wickedly.</p>

<p>　I’m sure he’s enjoying the sermon. He always says he’s doing it for your sake, but that’s a lie.</p>

<p>　He’s a scumbag who likes to bully people who can never fight back. I’m so glad I was able to wake up to this.</p>

<p>　Even though I’m at ……, I still get sick to my stomach and my legs when I’m in front of this guy. At this rate, I doubt I’ll be able to successfully rebut him.</p>

<p>　As I’m thinking about what to do, my phone vibrates.</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>　I secretly check my phone so that Suda doesn’t find out.</p>

<p>　I see a message from Adachi, who I had been talking to earlier. What in the world is going on?</p>

<p>「Since it’s you, you’re still scared of Suda, right?　If that’s the case, think, ‘But I can kill this guy in an instant.’ Then you won’t be afraid.」</p>

<p>　…… I see.</p>

<p>　Suda used to be an explorer, so he’s stronger than most people, but he hasn’t dived in dungeons for a long time. I’m sure I’m stronger than him.</p>

<p>　If you look closely, you will see that Suda’s movements are full of gaps, not those of a warrior.</p>

<p>　If I close the distance in 0.2 seconds and hit him in the heart, …… yeah, it would take less than a second to kill him.</p>

<p>　Huh?　If you think about it that way, it might not be scary. Tyrant dragons are much scarier.</p>

<p>　I used to be afraid that they would make me quit my job, but now I don’t care if I quit, and there’s not a single part of me that’s afraid.</p>

<p>　I can do this.</p>

<p>　I decided that I am ready to fight this time, so I secretly touch my phone and do a certain operation. Once I do this, there’s no going back.</p>

<p>“Okay, ……, we’ve got enough people here. Tanaka, let’s start …….”</p>

<p>　When about 10 employees gathered, Suda came in front of me with a wicked smile on his face.</p>

<p>　I knew he was having fun.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Tanaka, what you have done. Make it clear to the other employees!”</p>

<p>　Suda says in a voice so loud that the office shakes.</p>

<p>　This is his usual phrase. First, he makes the employee explain and instills a sense of guilt.</p>

<p>　Then, after getting them to talk, he interrupts them, silences them, and then yells at them to take control of the conversation.</p>

<p>　Then the employee shrinks and can’t say anything. He’s really a bad guy.</p>

<p>　The other employees are remembering what he did to them, or perhaps they have a dark look on their faces. I would have had the same look on my face.</p>

<p>“It was my fault for making a mistake in the stream settings and leaking the contents of the business to the outside world. I do feel bad about that.”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Suda gave a disgusting smile.</p>

<p>　I guess the pattern for breaking my heart is building up in my head from here.</p>

<p>　If it had been before, things might have gone accordingly, but not on this particular day.</p>

<p>“But that’s it. Right now the Internet is giving the Black Dog Guild a bad name, but it’s all your fault. I had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“……You, what did you just say?’</p>

<p>　Suda, who looked surprised, belatedly realized that what he had said had been denied, and his face turned red.</p>

<p>” ‘I had nothing to do with it’?!　Who the hell do you think you are?!”</p>

<p>　Suda angrily kicked a nearby trash can.</p>

<p>　The trash inside scatters, and the employees tremble at the sight of it.</p>

<p>“You understand that this guild is in the black, don’t you, Suda?　It just came to light. If what I didn’t do spread, it’s my fault, but what I did spread. And you were the one who made me do it.”</p>

<p>“Are you saying that our company is black?　I don’t think so!　We pay you a minimum wage and give you a day off once a month!　And who is it that picked up you scum that no other guild would hire to work for them in the first place?”</p>

<p>　I laugh a little in my heart at the collection of black company quotes that overflow like hot water when I poke them lightly.</p>

<p>　I wonder how many people hear these words and think, ‘This guild is doing it right.’ I’d like to take a survey.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the one who cuts our salary? 　And even your time off is below the Labor Standards Act for Explorers. Do you think I haven’t noticed?”</p>

<p>“Guu……. That’s fine! I also do government work! That means I’m the government!”</p>

<p>　Oh, this is no good.</p>

<p>　This guild is already blacked out. The other employees are backing down. They will be leaving soon.</p>

<p>……Well, now that I’ve gotten a lot out of him, it’s time to break the story.</p>

<p>　I don’t want to hear any more of his annoying voice.</p>

<p>“Suda, I’m really sorry - I’ve known you for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh? What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>　I took out my phone and showed him the screen.</p>

<p>　There’s a huge amount of comments flowing in there. ……</p>

<p>「Wow, wow, the black quotes keep coming up.」</p>

<p>「The darkness of Japan.」</p>

<p>「This is already a police matter, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「This is too much!」</p>

<p>「 It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a livestream this exciting.」</p>

<p>「Hey, Mr. President, are you watching this?」</p>

<p>「Hey, how do you feel now?　How do you feel?」</p>

<p>「Bankruptcy confirmed.」</p>

<p>「Thinking about it, If this is the case, the president can no longer escape.」</p>

<p>「Thank God for the retirement RTA.」</p>

<p>「I feel a great sense of unity.」</p>

<p>「I’ll never be a company employee again… ……, even though the dark circles in his eyes are cute…」</p>

<p>「I think I’m going to retire too ……」</p>

<p>“Hey, what the hell is this ……!”</p>

<p>　Suda’s face turns blue.</p>

<p>　He seems to have finally understood his situation.</p>

<p>“These days drones are very sophisticated, aren’t they, Suda? They even have a camouflage mode. Thanks to that, I was able to stream this without being detected.”</p>

<p>　I operated my phone to bring out the drone, which had disappeared until now.</p>

<p>　Yes, I had streamed the whole sequence of events on the D-tube. Thanks to my streaming incident, the number of subscribers to the Black Dog Guild’s channel is exploding. Soon, viewers would be flocking to the site.</p>

<p>“Guu, this …… stupid ……!”</p>

<p>“Give it up, Suda. It’s time to pay your tribute.”</p>

<p>　I told Suda, who was trembling with anger.</p>

<p>…</p>
