<p>TL: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>「Tell him, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「This is a clean Japan.」</p>

<p>「Suda! How do you feel now?」</p>

<p>「 〇〇ァ, It’s become a common phrase these days.」(Tl: both Tanaka and Suda’s names follow this format:”田中ァ”, and “須田ァ”)</p>

<p>「I’m so happy I ate five bowls of white rice.」</p>

<p>「That’s too lame.」
<!--more--></p>

<p>「Tanaka……, you’re the star of all the employees.」(Tl: Funny cuz employee here also translates to livestock xD)</p>

<p>「Is this where the festival will be held today?」</p>

<p>「I’ve reported you to the Labor Bureau.」</p>

<p>「Suda-kun’s reactions are all so petty and weedy.」</p>

<p>　Just glancing around, I saw a large number of comments.</p>

<p>　Okay, a lot of viewers are properly coming. I haven’t checked, but I’m sure the social networking sites are all abuzz right now.</p>

<p>“You can’t get away now, Suda. So many eyes saw what you did. Or do you want to frighten them into keeping their mouths shut like you always do?　Well, I doubt if you can stop the mouths of all 200,000 viewers now.”</p>

<p>“You, you ……!”</p>

<p>　Suda’s face is bright red and his fists are shaking. If he goes that far, there is nothing more he can do.</p>

<p>　What this guy usually does is rule by fear. He’s not the smartest guy in the world, although he’s smart enough to know it:</p>

<p>　There is no way he can come up with a way out of this predicament.</p>

<p>“Tanaka, what the hell are you doing? Why did you do this?　Are you trying to get back at me for using you like this?”</p>

<p>“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel that way. I wasted a lot of valuable time because of you. But …… that’s already in the past, it doesn’t matter. What matters is the future.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, by ‘the future’?”</p>

<p>　Suda tilted his head.</p>

<p>“I’m going to live for myself from now on. I’m going to quit this company first for that purpose. I haven’t decided what I will do after that, but I will either live as a freelancer or find another job.”</p>

<p>　Suda lets out a small laugh in response.</p>

<p>　This is the way he laughs when he makes fun of someone.</p>

<p>“You, a freelancer?　Re-employment?　What the hell are you talking about?　You know what?　You’re nothing without me!　You can’t work anywhere else!”</p>

<p>　Suda’s voice was shrill as he yelled at the employees around him, “And you too!” .</p>

<p>　I don’t know how I managed to work for such a guy for so long. ……</p>

<p>“I understand your point. Then why don’t we ask them if I can work for somewhere else?”</p>

<p>“Oh?　What the hell are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness 200,000 people are here for this stream. Oh, three hundred thousand people already? Why don’t we ask them?”</p>

<p>　I spoke to the drone.</p>

<p>“If I leave this company, is there any place that will hire me?”</p>

<p>　The moment I ask this, a large number of comments begin to flow.</p>

<p>Scarlet Wolf Guild: 「Yes, yes!　Please join our guild!」</p>

<p>Golden Lion Guild: 「No, ours!　We’ll give you twice as much money as any other!」</p>

<p>The Silver Cat Guild: 「Well, …… I’d be happy if you would come to my place, …….」</p>

<p>Obsidian Bear Guild: 「How about me?　I’d love to have a nice guy like you!」</p>

<p>Bronze Serpent Guild: 「If you join us, …… we’ll take care of that deafening garbage.」</p>

<p>　One after another, solicitations fly in from the official accounts of various guilds.</p>

<p>　Some of them are well-known guilds that are difficult to join.</p>

<p>　I’ve never been asked to join a guild like this before, so my heart is filled with emotion. Oh no, I’m going to cry.</p>

<p>　Some of the comments were, 「Please team up with me!」 or 「I’ll assist you, so why don’t you become a freelancer?」</p>

<p>　I think it was a joke, but some of them even said, 「I want to work for you permanently!」 What a thing to say.
　Everyone is so kind.</p>

<p>“Here’s your answer, Suda. Your brainwashing is over. No words can get through to me.”(Tl: That’s one way to give a slap to the face)</p>

<p>“You, you, you, ……!”</p>

<p>　But this guy had not given up yet.</p>

<p>“Who was it that got you, a poor student, into my father’s company?　Who paid for your parents’ hospital bills?　It was all me!　You’re betraying a man to whom you owe so much!”</p>

<p>“I’ve already repaid you. You’re the one who betrayed me. The old me actually wanted to work with you.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you ungrateful bastard!”</p>

<p>　Furious, Suda opens a desk drawer and pulls out a dagger from inside.
　This is a deadly weapon, the kind you would use in a dungeon, isn’t it? If you take out such a thing outside the dungeon, you will be in violation of the Dungeon Management Law.</p>

<p>“You’ll die here, Tanaka!”</p>

<p>　Suda grips it with his right hand and thrusts it toward my stomach.
　The screams of the employees spread throughout the company. But I was perfectly calm.</p>

<p>“…… It’s too slow.”</p>

<p>　The monster’s movements were much slower than those of the monsters that appear in the depths.</p>

<p>　This guy used to be a lot stronger, but he’s totally fallen off his game.</p>

<p>　I slap Suda’s Dagger with my hand</p>

<p>　Suda’s hand swells up bright red and he drops the knife to the ground.</p>

<p>“Gah!”</p>

<p>“It’s over, Suda. You should know a little bit about people’s pain.”</p>

<p>　I punched Suda in the gut.</p>

<p>“Gusto!”</p>

<p>　I was pretty easy on him, but Suda’s body bent backwards, and he was blown away.</p>

<p>　Then he slammed into the wall like a bullet and fell to the floor!</p>

<p>　Phew…it was refreshing.</p>

<p>　I hope he learns a little from this.</p>
