<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Ta-Tanaka…”</p>

<p>　I had already informed him of my intention to resign and was about to leave, when Suda stood up.</p>

<p>“I won’t forgive you, Tanaka,……, for making me look like a fool,……!”</p>

<p>　Suda’s eyes are still filled with anger.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Even standing seems to be painful, but it seems that his heart is not broken yet. I guess his mountainous self-esteem won’t allow him to stay down.</p>

<p>　If I attacked him any more, he might die, so it’s hard for me to do anything.</p>

<p>“You guys!　What the hell are you doing?　Kill that criminal who raised his hand against me!”</p>

<p>　Suda shouted, looking as if he didn’t know which one of us was the criminal.</p>

<p>　Naturally, the employees were puzzled, and were questioning what they should do.</p>

<p>“You really are a bunch of useless employees, you know that?　You!　Just stop him!　You’ll get a pay cut!”(Tl: What a boss ¬_¬)</p>

<p>“Hey!”</p>

<p>　Suda spots an employee and uses his black magic to win the heart of the employee, telling him, “If I stop paying you now, you’ll be in trouble,” or “You won’t be able to work in this industry anymore.</p>

<p>　The employee quickly becomes Suda’s puppet.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’ll just hold you down and won’t hurt you. ……”</p>

<p>　The employee, who succumbed to the threat, faced me with his bare hands.</p>

<p>　This employee had joined the company last year and was one of the leading youngsters, as I recall.</p>

<p>　I’ve never dived in a dungeon with him, so I don’t know how good he is.</p>

<p>“Okay, come at me”</p>

<p>“Yes…….”</p>

<p>　The employee leaned forward and rushed forward at once.</p>

<p>　It is certainly a good move if you want to seize your opponent.</p>

<p>　But his movements are too linear and slow.</p>

<p>　I pull myself back from the tackle just in time and aim my hand at the back of his exposed neck.
　 I’m sure he didn’t even realize what had happened.</p>

<p>　I moved the employee to the side so that he would not be caught in the middle of the situation, and then I looked at Suda again.</p>

<p>　Suda looked at me and gritted his teeth in frustration.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to let you get away with just a pay cut,…….”</p>

<p>“Give it up already, Suda. This is all being streamed too. It’s over for you and this company.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to let you get away with this! I won’t let you ruin the company!　Hey, Gouda, get him!”</p>

<p>　Suda shouts, and a large man comes forward from among the employees.</p>

<p>　He is Masato Gouda, an explorer belonging to the Black Dog Guild.</p>

<p>　He stands 190 cm tall and has a muscular body. His hair is short and coiffed, and his face is stern.</p>

<p>　Unlike the young employee earlier, Gouda is a strong explorer with a Class A explorer’s license. Suda also depends on Gouda.</p>

<p>“Gouda!　Kill him!”</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>　Gouda silently stands in front of me.</p>

<p>　He’s my junior, but we’ve been in the dungeon together many times. I’m sure it won’t be as easy to beat him as it was earlier.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san, you are finally quitting. I’m rooting for you.</p>

<p>“Eh……?”</p>

<p>　Gouda congratulates me in a low, scary voice.</p>

<p>　What’s going on?</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about it for a while. Tanaka-san is not the right person to be in this guild. You are the kind of person who should be fighting on a bigger stage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, um, thank you?”(Tl: “Ah etto-, arigatou”, but unlike your imagination, it’s a tall muscular guy saying it (˘̩̩̩̩̩̩∩˘̩̩̩̩̩̩))</p>

<p>　When we dived in the dungeon together, I thought he didn’t like me because he was quiet and didn’t talk to me at all, but it seems he didn’t.</p>

<p>　Gouda congratulated me with a look of heartfelt happiness. Naturally, Suda did not like his attitude,</p>

<p>“Gouda,” he said, “ why are you wagging your tail at such a scum?”</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san is my senior who taught me the basics of being an explorer, and I can’t possibly agree to such a request no matter how many times the president orders me to do so. Even if …… I really attacked him, I would only get a backhanded blowback. I’m sure the president knows that, too.”</p>

<p>“Ugh,……!”</p>

<p>　I don’t think that’s true. I think I could have a good match with Gouda.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san. I’ll stop the president. Please go.”</p>

<p>“Really?　Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>　I patted Gouda on the back and turned to leave the company.</p>

<p>　I can hear Suda’s noisy voice from behind me, but I don’t care.</p>

<p>　I can finally get rid of this company. The next moment I thought that, …… suddenly the door to the company opens with a bang.</p>

<p>“Everyone stop, please. This is the Audit Department of the Operations Bureau of the Association. We have received a call.”</p>

<p>　A group of people dressed in suits entered.</p>

<p>“The Operations Bureau of the Association, as they called themselves, is an internal department of the Ministry of Monster Control, in other words, a government organization. They must have received a report from a viewer who was streaming the video. Well, if you do something so spectacular, you’re bound to get reported, right?”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha-ha!　The wind is blowing my way, Tanaka!　Government officials!　Catch that criminal!　He’s the criminal who raised his hand against me!”(Tl: His level of delusion continues to surprise and amuse me ( ᐛ )و)</p>

<p>　Suda shouts happily.</p>

<p>　But the officials pass me by and grab Suda and take him into custody.</p>

<p>“Hee……?”</p>

<p>　Suda shouts in a crazy voice.</p>

<p>　While I was unable to comprehend the situation, a female official in a suit stood in front of Suda and said:</p>

<p>“Akihiro Suda, we are detaining you for violating the Labor Standards for Explorers and the Special Law for Awakened Persons.”</p>
