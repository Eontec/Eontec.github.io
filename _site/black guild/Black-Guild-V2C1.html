<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Fuah …… good night’s sleep.”</p>

<p>　It is around noon the day after the retirement fiasco.</p>

<p>　I wake up without an alarm for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>　I haven’t had such a pleasant morning in months…… or even years.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　I couldn’t sleep well on my occasional days off because of the dread of the next day’s work. From now on, I can sleep as much as I want every day, and it makes me feel lighter.</p>

<p>　But well, my wallet will be lighter too. ……</p>

<p>　My heart sinks when I think about it.</p>

<p>　I don’t think the Black Dog Guild will give me a decent severance payment.</p>

<p>　Suda has been arrested and the guild will effectively be dissolved. No one would want to rebuild that company.</p>

<p>“The remaining employees will have a hard time, and you can’t just walk in there and ask them to give you a severance payment. …… They’re victims too.”</p>

<p>　Call me naive, but I’d give up getting severance pay.</p>

<p>Besides, I didn’t have time to spend money when I was a corporate employee, so I’ve been able to save a little. Well, it’s not that much because my salary was low to begin with.</p>

<p>　But I’m still hungry…… I fell asleep as soon as I got home last night. Maybe I should go out for something to eat.</p>

<p>　As I am thinking this, my phone vibrates as if on cue.</p>

<p>　I look at the screen and see a message from Adachi.</p>

<p>《I guess it’s about time you got up?　We have something to talk about, so let’s go out for dinner.》</p>

<p>“…… Did that guy plant a camera in my house?”</p>

<p>　I get a little scared and look around the room, but I don’t see anything like that.</p>

<p>　His perceptive skills are a bit frightening.</p>

<p>“I’m a little hungry, so I’ll go. I’ve got some things I want to talk about.”</p>

<p>　I quickly get ready and leave the house.</p>

<p>　I put on my business suit as usual. I haven’t been out for a few years now, so I have nothing else to wear. ……</p>

<p>　I’d like to go shopping for clothes next time. ……</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>“Hey, Tanaka!　I saw your stream!　That was a good romp!”</p>

<p>　I go to a nearby family restaurant and meet up with Adachi. Like me, he was dressed in a suit and tie.</p>

<p>I wonder how long it’s been since I’ve eaten out.　I usually just eat at convenience stores or supermarket bento boxes. I do eat some of the food in the dungeon, though.</p>

<p>“I’ve been eating at convenience stores and supermarkets. What would happen if people find out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re already a celebrity, huh?　It’s hard being popular.”</p>

<p>“I’m going home.”</p>

<p>“Hey, I’m sorry!　I’m kidding, I’m kidding!”</p>

<p>　He desperately tries to stop me, and I have no choice but to take my seat.</p>

<p>“You always say three words too many.”(Tl: I love their frienship dynamic)</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I just felt like talking a lot. You can ask for as much as you like as an apology. It’s a retirement gift.”</p>

<p>　I don’t think it’s a retirement gift to go to a family restaurant, but as an unemployed person, it’s a big help to me.</p>

<p>　I call up the waiter and order without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Extra large cheeseburger and fries. And this steak too. …… Yes, the biggest size you can get. Please add a large serving of rice too. And a big curry plate and the largest pasta plate. And the drink bar and the pancake tower. That’s all for now.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lot!”</p>

<p>　I finish my order, despite Adachi’s disgusted look.</p>

<p>　I’m sure that’s all I need.</p>

<p>“Hey, Tanaka!　You’re asking too much, it’s just a family restaurant!　You’re going to run out of money!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a great wife. It’s a good thing.”</p>

<p>　Seeing Adachi scowling, I smiled at him.</p>

<p>　You underestimated my stomach.</p>

<p>“I forgot you’re an active explorer ……. You move around so much, of course you’re going to eat.”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“You know, the dark circles in your eyes have gotten a lot better. You look a little healthier.”</p>

<p>　It’s true that when I was a corporate employee, I had a dead face.</p>

<p>　The face I saw in the mirror in the morning had recovered to the point of near-death. I wish I could go back to the face of the living.</p>

<p>“By the way, Adachi, what is it that you want to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Well, let’s get started while we wait for the food to arrive..”</p>

<p>　Adachi took a document out of his business bag and put it in front of me.</p>

<p>　The document had letters written on it</p>

<p>　The title of the document was “Makoto Tanaka, The Road to Becoming a Popular Streamer.”</p>

<p>“This is …….”</p>

<p>I made it in my spare time from work,” he said. You don’t know much about streaming anyway, do you?　But don’t worry, I’ll make sure I’ll make you a world-class streamer.”</p>

<p>　Adachi sipped the remaining Coke from the bottom of the bottle with a straw and said this with a sly grin on his face.</p>
