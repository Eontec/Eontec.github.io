<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for cuting off the stream so abruptly. Now I am going to escape from the West Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon, where something unusual is happening, with Hoshino-san.”
<!--more--></p>

<p>「We’re going to start as if nothing happened, lmao.」</p>

<p>「I won’t leave you alone. ……」</p>

<p>「Holy shit, it’s back on ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━!」</p>

<p>「I’m sure everyone remembers all that.」</p>

<p>「Streaming resumed (after two minutes).」</p>

<p>「What did you do in those two minutes?　I’m curious!」</p>

<p>「Young men and women, nothing happened. ……」</p>

<p>「I’ve taken off my clothes for now!　What should I do next?」</p>

<p>　Ignoring the comments section, which as usual likes to talk about the juicy stuff, I start to return to the dungeon with Hoshino.</p>

<p>　It would be quickest if I could return home while smashing through the ceiling, but Hoshino wouldn’t be able to keep up with me if I made such a move. Inevitably, it would take longer than it did on the way there.</p>

<p>“Are you okay?　Can you run on your own two feet?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, yes!　I’m totally fine!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino smiles brightly, as if she is fine.</p>

<p>　As a power fighter, she is not the fastest person on her feet. I have to be careful not to fly too fast.</p>

<p>“By the way, why don’t you party with others, Hoshino?　Even if you don’t join a guild, I don’t think you’d be in danger in the middle tier if you’re with someone else.”</p>

<p>“Ahh, ……. I often get invitations to collaborate with people, but the only people who approach me are men with kind of scary eyes. ……”</p>

<p>“I see. ……”</p>

<p>　Scary eyes, in other words, are probably the guys who are ‘aiming’ at Hoshino.</p>

<p>　The stream is a building block, and the real deal comes afterwards. The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help.</p>

<p>　At first glance, she seems natural and easily fooled.</p>

<p>　If a natural and extraordinarily cute girl was streaming alone, she would be targeted by hungry streamers.</p>

<p>　It’s amazing that she hasn’t been targeted yet.</p>

<p>“So I’ll be your first collaborator?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are!”</p>

<p>“Haha, I’m kind of sorry. I’m sorry that this old man is your first collaborator.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not like that!　I’m really happy that my first person is Tanaka-san!” (TL: Comments are going to love this)</p>

<p>　After Hoshino said that, she realized she had said something outrageous and blushed, “ Ah”. Naturally, the comments section is abuzz.</p>

<p>「Yes, we got ‘first timer’.」</p>

<p>「She’s too natural, isn’t she? ……」</p>

<p>「You’re just in time for the Shachiken, aren’t you?」</p>

<p>「I’m so glad you’re my first. That’s the line I want to hear the most..」</p>

<p>「 Uncle, you’re making my heart flutter.」</p>

<p>「I’m having heart palpitations.」</p>

<p>「They’ve had sex!」</p>

<p>「This girl is too cute. I want to promote you, so please come back alive. ……」　</p>

<p>　I’ll leave the comments alone because I can’t seem to stop them no matter what I say.</p>

<p>　Huh, there’s no way this cute girl is going to be attracted to me. The viewers should look at reality a little.</p>

<p>“Um, I’m sorry. I ……”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind. It’s okay, the audience seems to be having fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, I meant what I said before, …….”</p>

<p>”—-?”</p>

<p>　I heard a sound and stopped.</p>

<p>　 Hoshino also stopped, panicking.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“Shh. I hear someone’s voice.”</p>

<p>“What?　I don’t hear anything ……”</p>

<p>“it’s over there.”</p>

<p>　I listened carefully and determined the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>　There was no doubt. This is a human voice. And I also hear what sounds like a battle going on.</p>

<p>「Yeah, I didn’t hear anything.」</p>

<p>「I blasted up the sound on the video, but I can’t hear it.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure drones nowadays have pretty sophisticated microphones on them. ……」</p>

<p>「Shachidken`s ears must be even more powerful than that.」</p>

<p>「*He worked for a very special company.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka’s Ears are from hell」.</p>

<p>「I turned up the sound to the limit in my software and there really was a faint human voice. Why can’t I hear it?」</p>

<p>「Why are there people here?」</p>

<p>「Well, they said there were a couple of explorers in there this morning, so that must be it.」</p>

<p>「…… Isn’t this bad?　There’s something unusual going on right now.」</p>

<p>　If the commenters are right and those explorers are being attacked by strong monsters, it’s a bad situation. We should go help them right now.</p>

<p>　But we can’t leave Hoshino alone either. As I was wondering what to do, Hoshino tugged on my sleeve.</p>

<p>“Let’s go, Tanaka-san,” she said. I can’t just go home and leave the others alone!”</p>

<p>“But ……”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can handle it!　I’m sure I won’t pull you back. So please.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino looks straight at me with a gaze filled with a strong will.</p>

<p>　It’s a very different thing from me with dead fish eyes. I’d be the bad guy if I refused her request.</p>

<p>“Just run away if it’s dangerous, okay?</p>

<p>“Yes, I will!　Thank you very much!”</p>

<p>　The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you’re getting into.</p>

<p>　The ship has come this far. We’ll save everyone and get back on the ground.</p>

<p>“Let’s go then. Follow me!”</p>

<p>“Okay!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino and I ran toward the voice as fast as we could.</p>

<p>　It took us only a few minutes to see the owner of the voice.</p>

<p>　There they were, a party of five explorers. They were fighting a nasty monster called a labyrinth magician.</p>

<p>　The Labyrinth Magician is a monster that looks like a black mist wearing a robe. It has a staff in its hand from which it unleashes a variety of magical attacks.</p>

<p>　The fog-like part is not solid and can be easily defeated by cutting or burning the robe, but it is a difficult opponent because of the variety of magic it uses.</p>

<p>　These monsters are from the lower levels, but they seem to have appeared here because of the unusual situation.</p>

<p>　The explorers seem to be in danger. We have to hurry and save them.</p>

<p>“For the second time today, it’s time for —- business.”</p>

<p>　I switched to business mode and cut my way through the monsters at once.</p>
