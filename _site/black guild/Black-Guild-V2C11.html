<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　For a swordsman like me, wizard-type enemies like the Labyrinth Magician are not my type of opponent.</p>

<p>　It is partly because there is no way to deal with attacks from a distance, but the most important thing is that their movements are unreadable.</p>

<p>　I don’t think I’m alone in this, but the swordsmen can sense their opponent’s actions based on the slightest movement. They can sense an advance by the slackness of the knees, and read the aim by the movement of the eyes.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Whether the opponent is a human or a monster, they can read the subtleties of the opponent’s movements to determine their next move.</p>

<p>　However, this is not the case with wizards.</p>

<p>　They can use a wide variety of magic with a light wave of their wands.</p>

<p>　It’s like a kick or an elbow coming at you as you make a punching motion. There is no way to read their moves.</p>

<p>　The most important thing to remember is that you don’t have to be a wizard to read the magic essence of your opponent. …… You need to defeat 10,000 wizard monsters to do that.</p>

<p>　But I’ve established an effective means of getting around without having to do that.</p>

<p>“If you cut them before they notice you, they won’t be able to use their magic,……!”</p>

<p>　I close the distance in an instant and cut the labyrinth magician in two with a single vertical slash.</p>

<p>　The robe was cut in half, the black mist inside dissipated, and the staff in his hand fell to the floor with a sound.</p>

<p>　The robe is the main body of the Labyrinth Magician. If you inflict more than a certain amount of damage on it, you can defeat it like this.</p>

<p>『……！！』</p>

<p>　The other Labyrinth Magicians, realizing that their ally had been killed, point their wands at me. But Labyrinth Magicians need two seconds to fire their magic.</p>

<p>　I approach them in less than a second and slice through the Labyrinth Magicians as fast as I can. It’s a troublesome opponent in a normal fight, but if I don’t let them use magic, there is no other opponent as easy as this.</p>

<p>「 This guy can’t use any magic, Lmao.」</p>

<p>「Labyrinth Magicians are supposed to be quite troublesome monsters. ……」</p>

<p>「Q. I can’t deal with my opponent’s magic. a. Cut them before they use magic.」</p>

<p>「If you could do that, you wouldn’t have any trouble. ……」</p>

<p>「I feel a sense of emptiness and somehow excitement when I see the Labyrinth Magician who I ran away from before because I couldn’t defeat it get beat up.」</p>

<p>「Someone’s waking up, lmao.」</p>

<p>「The viewers’ sexuality is already in shambles.」</p>

<p>　After I defeat about four Labyrinth Magicians, the remaining Labyrinth Magicians take a step away. I glanced over and saw that Hoshino had also defeated one Labyrinth Magician.</p>

<p>　It seemed that they had become wary of me after five of their own had been killed.</p>

<p>　I took the opportunity to approach the leader of the defeated explorers and talk to him.</p>

<p>“I’m here to help you, can you tell me what’s going on?”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your help. ……  Shachiken-san!　the real thing!”</p>

<p>　When I said this in surprise, the other explorers saw me and started to make a fuss.</p>

<p>　I knew they already remembered my face. ……</p>

<p>“Um, could you tell us what’s going on ……?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry!　I just got excited.”</p>

<p>　The explorer told me that the five of them were originally two different parties exploring the area, but they realized something was wrong and tried to escape together.</p>

<p>“We were so close to getting out to the upper levels, and then we got caught by a Labyrinth Magician …….”</p>

<p>“I understand the situation ……. I will clear the way for you. I’ll clear the way for you, and you can escape during that time”.</p>

<p>“No, but ……”</p>

<p>“I will clear the way for you. I’ve beaten Labyrinth Magician enough times to make you sick.”</p>

<p>　I said that, and I shoved my hand into the inside pocket of my suit and took out my business bag from there.</p>

<p>“Eeh!　Where did you find that in there?”</p>

<p>“This suit is specially made. It has a lot of pockets to hold things.”</p>

<p>「What?　Dimensional expansion items are extremely rare, you know?」</p>

<p>「If you sold it, it would be worth tens of millions, right?」</p>

<p>「I like it. It looks useful.」</p>

<p>「You can only get that kind of item in the deeper levels.」</p>

<p>「This guy went to the depths by himself. ……」</p>

<p>「That reminds me.」</p>

<p>　Sometimes items with special effects are dropped in dungeons.</p>

<p>　I have a couple of special items in my possession that I was usingt. By the way, I didn’t tell Suda because if I reported it to him, he would take it.</p>

<p>『Uu…… Raa!』</p>

<p>　One of the Labyrinth Magicians, becoming desperate, shoots a huge fireball at us. It was easy to avoid the fireball, but if I did, it might hit another explorer.</p>

<p>　I stood right in front of the fireball and hit it back with the business bag in my hand.</p>

<p>” Hurrah!”</p>

<p>『Gah-gah!』</p>

<p>　The fireball hit the Labyrinth Magician. The Labyrinth Magician was consumed by his own flames and turned into charcoal.</p>

<p>「[Sad news] Labyrinth Magician. Loses to the business bag.」</p>

<p>「There’s really no one who can beat him」</p>

<p>「That flame must be thousands of degrees, but why is the bag safe?」</p>

<p>「I didn’t even know the flames could be shot back.」</p>

<p>「You can’t think of Shachiken on the scale of a normal human being. ……」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Nice smash!」</p>

<p>「I didn’t know there was such a method. I’ll give it a try.」</p>

<p>「I’m not saying it’s bad, just don`t do it. ……」</p>

<p>「*He worked for a very special company.」</p>

<p>　The other Labyrinth Magicians also shoot ice, lightning, and other magic at me, but I counter all of them with my bag.</p>

<p>　This ultra-hard business bag, 『AEGIS』 is an excellent bag that can even withstand the Tyrant Dragon’s flames. The Labyrinth Magician’s magic can’t even scratch it.</p>

<p>In no time at all, the number of Labyrinth Magicians is reduced to a handful, and I succeed in clearing the way to the upper level.</p>
