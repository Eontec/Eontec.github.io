<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　I was transferred with Hoshino by the magic of the black-robed magician, and I was experiencing the sensation of not being able to tell up, down, left or right.</p>

<p>　I wondered if this was what it was like in zero-gravity space, and while I was idly thinking about it, gravity suddenly returned.</p>

<p>“Whoa!”</p>

<p>“Kyaaa!”</p>

<p>　I quickly regained my position in the air and landed smoothly.</p>

<p>　The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you’re doing.</p>

<p>　The place where I arrived at is dark, so I can’t see it, but there is something soft and soft against my body. I think this might be a very bad situation.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it on purpose. Please don’t sue me.”</p>

<p>“Uu…… I won’t do that, please put me down…… I’m embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, sorry.”</p>

<p>　I put down Hoshino, I take out a spare drone from my business bag 『AEGIS』 and start it up. The drone I was using couldn’t arrive at the time of transition.</p>

<p>　I was glad that Adachi had given it to me in case it broke down. I had brought a light with me, but the drone was convenient because it freed up my hands.</p>

<p>　I connected it to my smartphone, and set the settings like this: …….</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s brighter now.”</p>

<p>　I turned on the drone’s light to illuminate my surroundings.</p>

<p>　The place we were sent to was a small cave. The cave was just wide enough for one person to pass through, and the road went all the way to the front and back, and it was hard to tell which was the exit.</p>

<p>　I was thrown into an awkward place. …… I don’t even know which way to go in this case. I’m not good at things that can’t be solved by cutting.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san. I’m really sorry”</p>

<p>“Hm?”</p>

<p>　When I turned around, I saw Hoshino standing there apologetically.</p>

<p>　She looked like she was about to start crying.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry that I brought you to this place ……. I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino seemed to be feeling quite responsible.</p>

<p>　I don’t mind at all. She’s usually working hard on her own, so I guess she’s not used to causing trouble for others. She seems to have a strong sense of responsibility and seems quite distressed.　</p>

<p>“You really don’t have to worry. You got hit by this magic in the first place because you protected the explorer earlier, didn’t you?　You didn’t make any mistake, there’s no need to feel responsible.”</p>

<p>“…… but it did put Tanaka-san in danger.”</p>

<p>“The concentration of magic essence is certainly high here. It’s probably the ‘deep level’. I always worked in the deep level. The deep layer is like a workplace for me, so to speak. Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino smiled for the first time since her transition.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san is truly a mysterious person, aren’t you? If it’s true, I should be in a hopeless situation, but …… I’m starting to feel kind of okay.”</p>

<p>“It seems everything is alright now. Then let’s make a plan to get out of here.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Um… if you can get out of here, please let me thank you! I don’t have any money, but… I’ll do anything I can!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said with full of spirit.</p>

<p>　I’m glad this isn’t being streamed right now. If it had been, the comments would have been a riot.</p>

<p>“So first, how do we find an exit?”</p>

<p>　After saying all that, I noticed something.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was clearly not looking good. I thought it might be, so I put my hand on her forehead.</p>

<p>“It’s …… hot. You obviously have a fever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, um, I’m fine,”</p>

<p>“No, no. The symptoms suggest that Hoshino is on the verge of “magic essence intoxication”. It is dangerous to walk around in this state.”</p>

<p>　Magic essence intoxication.</p>

<p>　It’s a reaction that appears when you ingest too much of the magic essence that abounds in the dungeon.</p>

<p>　The body is unable to expel the accumulated magic essence, causing physical problems. If it worsens, it can lead to death. Awakened people have a strong resistance to magic essence, but the concentration of magic essence is much higher in the deeper levels than in other levels.</p>

<p>　If Hoshino, who has never been in the deep layer before, is suddenly sent to this layer, it is inevitable that she will suffer from it.</p>

<p>“…… I may indeed be suffering from magic essence intoxication,” she said. But the only way to get rid of magic essence intoxication should be to endure it and wait for it to heal. I can’t keep Tanaka-san tied up here for too long because of me.”</p>

<p>“No, there is a way to cure it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a way, but ……, huh?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino nodded her head at my words.</p>

<p>“I was also suffering from magic essence intoxication during my company days because I was always in the deepest level of the dungeon. But then I found a way to cure it and succeeded.”</p>

<p>“Is there such a method?　How on earth……?”</p>

<p>“That’s…. This is it!”</p>

<p>　I take out mushrooms, plants, meat, and other ingredients from my business bag.</p>

<p>　They look different from ordinary foodstuffs in the supermarket, glowing, moving, and shaped strangely.</p>

<p>“What is this?”</p>

<p>These are ingredients from the dungeon. I’m going to use them to make an “exquisite magic essence-free dish” right now!</p>

<p>　Yes, this is how I recovered from my magic essence intoxication when I was a company employee.</p>

<p>　It is true that the food you can get in the dungeon doesn’t look very tasty. Some of them can cause magic essence intoxication if you eat them. But if you cook them properly, you can make delicious food.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was happy, too. She is also happy and says, “Wow. …….”</p>

<p>　I’ll have to put my skills to the test.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make it while streaming the video to report on my survival. Okay, let’s start the stream.”</p>

<p>　I pressed the button to start streaming, and I was eagerly ready to start cooking.</p>
