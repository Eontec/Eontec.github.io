<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Hello everyone. It is Makoto Tanaka. This stream continues to be brought to you from inside the ‘West Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon.’”</p>

<p>「Huh?　You resumed streaming?」  <br />
「Thank goodness!　You are safe!」   <br />
「Tanaka!　You’re alive!」   <br />
「Oh, my God, they’re streaming again!」   <br />
「Shachiken, I believed in you!」     <!--more-->
「The title is “Tanaka’s Labyrinth Cooking Course”, is there some kind of mistake?」   <br />
「There’s Yui in the back, isn’t there?　I’m glad you two are okay!」</p>

<p>“We have now moved to a new location and are somewhere in the depths. The concentration of magic essence is high here, and Hoshino-san, who is not accustomed to the deeper levels, is one step away from magic essence intoxication. I’m sure you’ve all had similar experiences.”</p>

<p>「Of course not!」   <br />
「There aren’t even 10% of all explorers who can go to the deeper levels. ……」  <br />
「When dungeons first appeared, there were a lot of people who got magic essence intoxication, but now you don’t hear much about it.」   <br />
「Humans must have evolved.」   <br />
「The percentage of people who have awakened has also increased.」  <br />
「What are you going to do about it, Yu-chan?　You can’t cure magic essence intoxication, right?」   <br />
「That’s right. The only way is to wait for the magic essence to be expelled naturally.」    <br />
「But in the deeper levels, the amount of magic element entering the body is greater than the amount being discharged, right? That’s no good.」   <br />
「Then aren’t you stuck?」</p>

<p>“…… It’s true that even if you take a normal break, Hoshino-san’s condition won’t get better. I used to crawl back to the lower level when I got magic essence intoxication, as if I was going to die.”</p>

<p>「Why did you continue to work under such circumstances?」   <br />
「Tanaka has a sad past: ……」    <br />
「Fighting monsters in the depths alone while suffering from magic essence intoxication is too much.」   <br />
「I wonder if there’s any footage of that?」   <br />
「I don’t think so, the Black Dog Guild’s account has disappeared.」   <br />
「The guild itself went under. Maybe there is some data in the confiscated items.」</p>

<p>“It won’t heal even if you do it normally, so …… I’m going to start cooking now. First, I’ll prepare a large pot and boil some water.”</p>

<p>「 The cooking has started lmao」   <br />
「 I really thought he mis-titled the stream!」   <br />
「Thank God for the cooking stream. I was just out of it.」    <br />
「New show Mako’s Kitchen.」   <br />
「I don’t even know what that means.」   <br />
「I can’t tell if it’s a joke or not.」       <br />
「Tanaka! Don’t cut your hands!」     <br />
「It’s normal with him that a pot comes out of a business bag and it’s lol. Naturally, it also has a special ability.」</p>

<p>　I fill the pot with water and put it on fire.  <br />
　By the way, the magic essence stove I’m using is an item that produces a special flame using magic essence as energy.   <br />
　This way, I don’t have to worry about running out of fuel in the dungeon, and more importantly, I don’t run out of oxygen, even in an enclosed space like a cave.</p>

<p>　It is the perfect item for cooking in the dungeon.</p>

<p>” Tanaka-san, please let me help you.”  <br />
“Are you all right?　You don’t have to strain yourself.”   <br />
“I’m fine if it’s just a little. I want to help, too.”  <br />
“…… got it. Then can you cut this into bite-sized pieces?”</p>

<p>　I said and handed the food to Hoshino.  <br />
　Hoshino received it and let out a frightened cry. Hoshino received it and let out a frightened cry.</p>

<p>“What is this?”  <br />
“Oh, it’s a mushroom called drain mushroom. Don’t you know it?”</p>

<p>　I handed her a black, poisonous looking mushroom.  <br />
　It’s not poisonous, so you don’t have to be afraid of it.</p>

<p>「You’re so freaked out!」  <br />
「Poor thing is so cute.」  <br />
「Yui, you look so cute with teary eyes」  <br />
「This mushroom looks like a monster.」  <br />
「Yui, are you afraid of mushrooms?　Uncle’s mushrooms are ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊」   <br />
「I’ve called the police.」   <br />
「Seriously, perverts are not allowed.」</p>

<p>“I don’t know!　What are these mushrooms?”    <br />
“This mushroom is a little special. It absorbs the magic essence of those who touch it. If eaten in moderation, it can alleviate the symptoms of magic essence intoxication.”   <br />
“I didn’t know there was such an ingredient. ……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino looked at the mushrooms she handed over to him sullenly.</p>

<p>“But how did you know about that?　That kind of information shouldn’t be known yet.”      <br />
“I told you in the stream today, I didn’t have time and money to eat properly, so I used to eat things in the dungeon. When I ate these mushrooms, the symptoms of magic essence intoxication did not appear.”        <br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>　When I said that, for some reason, both Hoshino and the commenters were taken aback.  <br />
　Am I that crazy?　It’s true that it looks bad, but it doesn’t taste that bad.</p>

<p>“There are other herbs that promote the release of magic essence and vegetables that reduce the amount of magic essence taken in. If you eat these, your symptoms should improve.”   <br />
“Ha ha ha …… thank you, thank you very much ……”</p>

<p>「Yui is making a funny face.」   <br />
「The ingredients in the pot, all of the ingredients I’ve never seen before, too scary.」   <br />
「The dark pot is on a cute level.」   <br />
「Is this the dungeon food I’ve heard so much about?」    <br />
「If I had to choose between eating this or dying, I honestly don’t know what I would do.」    <br />
「I could end up eating it and dying.」</p>

<p>“It’s nostalgic. In the old days, I used to eat a lot of food with high magic essence content, and when I started to get intoxicated, I would eat something that would remove the magic essence intoxication and repeat the process to increase my tolerance to it.”</p>

<p>「You’ve just come out with a bad idea.」  <br />
「If you take in that much magic essence, that’s how you become strong.
No one can imitate this kind of thing.」    <br />
「You’re doing the same thing as the poisoner!」</p>

<p>　Remembering the past, I stir the pot.  <br />
　There is meat in the pot, but it is also the meat of a wild boar-type monster called a 『dungeon boar』. The meat contains a lot of magic essence, but if you drain the blood properly, the magic essence will be removed.   <br />
　Other people don’t know about it because they don’t eat it, but it is an excellent meat because it contains a lot of strong meaty flavor.</p>

<p>“By the way, you shouldn’t eat shiny things like this because they contain a lot of magic essence.”</p>

<p>　I said as I showed them a glowing mushroom called “Luminous Cap”.        <br />
　It would be a bad idea for to imitate this and get magic essence intoxication.</p>

<p>「No one will eat them, so don’t worry.」     <br />
「Basically, we don’t eat shiny things.」   <br />
「Oh, he ate it raw.」    <br />
「What the hell is going on with this guy’s stomach?」   <br />
「Let’s stop using common sense to measure …….」</p>

<p>“……Yeah, it’s getting nice and cooked. All that’s left to do is to add a little salt from the dungeon,…… and.”</p>

<p>　The seasoning is simple because the ingredients have a lot of flavor.   <br />
　When the cooking is complete, I take the plate out of the bag and serve the soup.</p>

<p>“It’s a ‘special magic essence-free soup. Can you drink it?”  <br />
“Yes. ……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino accepted the plate with some hesitation.   <br />
　Then, after a few hesitant gestures, she scooped it up with a spoon and put it in her mouth.</p>

<p>「Ah! You really ate it!」  <br />
「You’re very brave.」  <br />
「Tanaka!　Where’s my portion?」   <br />
「I wouldn’t eat it even if you served it to me.」  <br />
「But it looks surprisingly delicious. ……」</p>

<p>　Hoshino gulped down a mouthful of soup.   <br />
　Then, she made a surprised expression on her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s delicious……!”    <br />
“I see. Good.”</p>

<p>「No way!　It’s really delicious!」  <br />
「That smile doesn’t lie, does it?」  <br />
「If Yui says so, I might want to try some. ……」   <br />
「I mean, it’s a basic rule that you’re not supposed to eat anything from the dungeon, so this stream is a very valuable resource, isn’t it?」   <br />
「I think all of Shachiken’s streams are valuable resources to begin with, aren’t they?」   <br />
「There are very few explorers who can go deep into the depths who are streaming.」    <br />
「Yui is too cute eating. I want to protect this smile. ……」    <br />
「There is Shachiken here, so you’re not needed」   <br />
「But it’s starting to look more and more delicious. ……」   <br />
「Yui, you look like you’re going to enjoy the food.」    <br />
「I’m getting hungry too.」   <br />
「That’s funny, it’s supposed to be a dungeon’s incomprehensible food. ……」</p>

<p>　Hoshino takes a second and third bite of the soup.  <br />
　I was a little nervous because it was the first time I’d made it for someone, but it looks like I made it safely and deliciously.</p>

<p>“My body is getting warmer and warmer, and I feel less queasy!”  <br />
　The magic essence has been drained from my body. If you eat too much, you’ll lose too much this time.”  <br />
“Yes, I will!　I understand!”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Hoshino started to eat the soup.   <br />
　Hoshino’s complexion improved rapidly. I’m sure she’ll be ready to go after a little rest.</p>
