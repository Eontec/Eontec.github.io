<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Thanks for the food!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said with a big smile on her face after finishing all the soup.</p>

<p>　For an awakened person, magic essence is an important substance. I was worried that it would be dangerous if all the magic essence was drained from the soup, but it seems that Hoshino’s physical condition is fine.</p>

<p>　It seems that her body had accumulated more magic essence than I had imagined. The fact that she was fine after accumulating that much means that she has a large tolerance.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Her fighting style was still rough, but she could be a great explorer if she trained herself.</p>

<p>　After finishing cleaning up the meal, I talked to her, intrigued by her talent.</p>

<p>“Hoshino ever learn how to fight from anyone?”</p>

<p>“No, I have never learned from anyone. I’ve only been in the dungeon a few times with other explorers to begin with. ……”</p>

<p>“Just a few times? Have you already estranged yourself from those people?”</p>

<p>“Well,…… they were a mixed party of men and women,…… and for some reason things got nasty when I entered. I was angry with one of the women who said, ‘It’s all messed up because you came in!’ so I left to escape.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino tells the story with sad eyes.</p>

<p>　She doesn’t seem to realize it, but I can only imagine what happened.</p>

<p>「Oh.」</p>

<p>「Party crasher Hoshino.」</p>

<p>「The princess of otaku」</p>

<p>「If a cute girl like her comes over, of course I’m going to like her.」</p>

<p>「It’s hard not to have bad intentions.」</p>

<p>「It’s a good thing she left.」</p>

<p>「I can imagine the ladies getting more and more upset because of all the guys giving Yui all the attention.」</p>

<p>「Yui’s so sweet, I bet the guys think ‘this girl likes me’.」</p>

<p>””</p>

<p>　It’s running through the comments, but it’s probably something like this.</p>

<p>　She’s kind, caring and open. It’s no wonder you’d think she has a thing for you.</p>

<p>　I wouldn’t be mistaken because I’m too old and there’s no way she’d like such a dead-eyed corporate animal in the first place, but if she were a little closer to me, I’d have been mistaken.</p>

<p>　But I’m the adult here, so I should tell her off so that there won’t be any more victims.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure what to say.　Men are creatures that fall in love with people who are …… kind to them. Especially when they are touched by a cute girl like Hoshino. It’s an instant kill move.”</p>

<p>“Eh?　Cute ……?</p>

<p>Hoshino’s face turns red. What happened to her?</p>

<p>“Ah, um, Do you think I’m cute ……?”</p>

<p>“What?　That’s right. There aren’t many girls that are as cute as Hoshino. If we were in the same class, I would have liked you for sure”.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow.”</p>

<p>「Yui, your face is so red and cute.」</p>

<p>「This company animal, you’re attacking too fast, aren’t you?」</p>

<p>「She have low self-esteem, so she can’t resist praise from others.」</p>

<p>「Yui’s face is so cute and squishy.」</p>

<p>「I love the way they’re holding hands. Cute.」</p>

<p>「Are you sure they’re not dating?」</p>

<p>「On the contrary, they only met today: ……」</p>

<p>「I heard that if you become a corporate slave, you can get a cute girl. I’m going to join the Black Dog Guild.」</p>

<p>「I’ve already joined the Black Dog Guild. I heard all the employees ran away.」</p>

<p>「I’ll only get sick if I join the Black Dog Guild.」</p>

<p>　The comments were noisy, but I ignored them. They’re probably having another silly argument.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking that, Hoshino opened her mouth as if she had made up her mind.</p>

<p>“Then,……,Um …… Tanaka, will you like me too,………? “</p>

<p>「Holy confession,━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！」</p>

<p>「Bold confession is a girl’s prerogative.」</p>

<p>「Is this the venue for today’s festival?」</p>

<p>「I was a fan of Yui, but …… I congratulate you, …… ugh.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Show us your manhood!」</p>

<p>「Uncle, my heart is pulsating. Is it heart palpitations?」</p>

<p>「I’m going to the hospital.」</p>

<p>「I threw up sugar.」</p>

<p>「Yui, you’re too cute.」</p>

<p>「I puked my <em>**</em>.」</p>

<p>「What will you say?　What’s he going to say?」</p>

<p>「Don’t underestimate the king of insensitivity, Tanaka. He won’t notice it anyway.」</p>

<p>「What? That’s not true. ……, right?」</p>

<p>“Haha, you say funny things, Hoshino. Are you sure you’re not mistaking me for someone else?” (Tl: The sacred techniques)</p>

<p>“Oh. Uh, …… I’m sorry, …….”</p>

<p>「Gyaaaaahhh!」</p>

<p>「He did it!　Seriously, that son of a bitch!」</p>

<p>「Gross!」</p>

<p>「Too dense…..」</p>

<p>「He drank the sugar I threw up.」</p>

<p>「YUI-CHIAN, you’re so cute!」</p>

<p>「You’re so cute even when you’re down.」</p>

<p>「I called the police.」</p>

<p>「Even the insensitive Tanaka noticed it. There was a time when I thought so too.」</p>

<p>　I try to keep my composure and say to Hoshino, “Be careful, okay?” I say to Hoshino.</p>

<p>　But in my heart, it was pretty dangerous. One more push and I might have lost my heart to the party crusher.</p>

<p>　Hoshino, you horrible girl. ……</p>

<p>“Let’s get back to the story. You said Hoshino hasn’t been taught how to fight, right?　That’s such a waste. Hoshino has talent. If you don’t learn how to fight with it, it will be a waste of treasure.”</p>

<p>“I have a talent?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino tilts her head with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>　She’s so cute with every move she makes.</p>

<p>“If you are a pure power fighter, I think you have more talent than I do. But it’s not enough as it is. In order to teach you what you lack, first try slashing at me with that sword with all your might.”</p>

<p>“What?　I can’t slash at you, Tanaka-san!</p>

<p>“It’s all right, you see. Trust me.”</p>

<p>“Trust, huh? I understand. ……”</p>

<p>「Yui, you’re so determined!」</p>

<p>「You trust him too much!」</p>

<p>「Well, I’m sure Shachiken will be fine.」</p>

<p>「Even if the worst happens, I’m sure Shachiken will be fine.」</p>

<p>「I know.」</p>

<p>　Hoshino swung her sword as hard as she could and swung it down at …… me.</p>

<p>　I catch the big swing with one hand from the front.</p>

<p>　Then, with a “gakki-gakku” sound, Hoshino’s sword swings at me!</p>

<p>“Eh!?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino, not expecting to be stopped like this, rolls her eyes in surprise. She was surprised.　The comments were also excited: “Really?”</p>

<p>Hoshino has the power, but her core is not in sync with her power. If she can fix that, she will become even stronger.</p>
