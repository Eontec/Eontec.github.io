<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>『Goaaaaaaaah!!!』</p>

<p>　As I run forward, the mount dragon roars in fury.</p>

<p>　I guess it had never experienced being thrown down before. He looks pretty angry.</p>

<p>『Grrrraaaa……!』</p>

<p>　The mount dragon opened his mouth wide and looked at me.</p>

<p>　Then his mouth began to glow red.</p>

<p>　The next moment I thought “No way,” and a huge heat ray shoots out of the mount dragon’s mouth. I quickly stepped to the side and was able to avoid it, but the dungeon wall where the heat ray hit was melted to mush.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“I never thought a solid dungeon wall could be like this. Looks pretty hot if it hits. ……”</p>

<p>「Is it only hot ……?」</p>

<p>「That’s the end of the story」</p>

<p>「People would be vaporized by something like this.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure Tanaka will be fine.」</p>

<p>「I’m shaking because it looks like he’s really going to be okay.」</p>

<p>　But still, a mount dragon can’t blow heat rays, can it?</p>

<p>　This one is not only big, but it seems to be a very special one. If we don’t defeat it soon, it might affect the outside too.</p>

<p>　If the magic essence concentration in the dungeon rises too high, the magic essence concentration in the space outside the dungeon ……, where ordinary people live, will also rise.</p>

<p>　When this happens, monsters leave the dungeon and begin to attack ordinary citizens.</p>

<p>　This phenomenon, called a “monster disaster,” rarely happens, but once it does, the damage is enormous.</p>

<p>　Last year, I believe, the news reported that a small country was destroyed by this phenomenon.</p>

<p>　We can’t let that happen in Japan.</p>

<p>『Gaaaah!』</p>

<p>　The mount dragon moves its body at a speed that doesn’t match its huge body, and tries to crush me with its foot.</p>

<p>　It would have been painful to be trampled by this huge body. I jumped to the side to avoid it, but the mount dragon swung its legs down on me again and again in an insistent attempt to crush me.</p>

<p>「I’m so scared lol.」</p>

<p>「Oh, the mountain is coming down.」</p>

<p>「It feels so immersive.」</p>

<p>「It’s shaking so much. It’s like an earthquake.」</p>

<p>「Sometimes it’s sunny, sometimes it’s a mountain.」</p>

<p>「But seriously, how is he going to knock it down?　I mean, it’s impossible for a single person to take down a mountain.」</p>

<p>「Well, I’m sure it’ll be fine. I don’t know how he’ll do it though.」</p>

<p>「I live in Shinjuku and it’s shaking a little ……」</p>

<p>「There was a real earthquake and I’m really feeling it…」</p>

<p>　As I looked at the comments while avoiding it, I realized to my surprise that this shaking was happening all the way up to the top of the dungeon. This might cause some injuries if we don’t settle this soon.</p>

<p>‘Gah!’</p>

<p>　The mount dragon swung its leg down as hard as it could.</p>

<p>　I ducked it and fired a blow with my iai.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-style kenjutsu, Blink!”</p>

<p>　With a “Ging!”　The front legs of the mount dragon are sliced in two.</p>

<p>　The mount dragon loses its balance and falls to the ground, hitting its head hard against the ground.</p>

<p>「Seriously, he did it!」</p>

<p>「Such a thick leg in an instant …….」</p>

<p>「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the strongest!」</p>

<p>「Today’s tie was amazing. Are there any overseas visitors here?」</p>

<p>「It looks like overseas D-tubers spread the word. I think some overseas D-tubers have spread the word that the samurai from back then is still at it.」</p>

<p>「I remember when the first stream went viral. I miss it.」</p>

<p>「This is a composite video, right?　Please tell me it is!」 （Tl: said in English)</p>

<p>「Here we go!」</p>

<p>「First time in Shachiken, huh?　Well, take your time.」</p>

<p>「You’re just starting to act like you’re an old-timer.」</p>

<p>『Gaaaah ……aaaah!”』</p>

<p>　The mount dragon grunts in pain as its leg falls off.</p>

<p>　When the mount dragon tried to approach to finish him off, he pressed the severed side of his arm against a rock that had fallen nearby.</p>

<p>　The next moment, the rock changed shape and became a new leg of the mount dragon.</p>

<p>　I never would have guessed that a fallen rock could repair a body, what kind of regenerative power does he have? Maybe that’s the reason why this thing has grown so big.</p>

<p>　Maybe it grew up by taking in all the rocks in the area.</p>

<p>But …… it’s still the same thing. It can only regenerate so many times, right?</p>

<p>　If it regenerates, you can cut it over and over again.</p>

<p>　When I took a step closer, the mount dragon stepped back, still staring at me. It seems that the blow I had just struck had put him on alert.</p>

<p>「[Sad news] Mount Dragon-san is scared.」</p>

<p>「Dragon is scared!　Hey hey hey!」</p>

<p>「Its legs are shaking. He’s so cute.」</p>

<p>「Mount Dragon, I’m crying because he’s being mounted by the viewers.」</p>

<p>「I pity him!」</p>

<p>「If I ever become a monster, I don’t want to meet Shachiken alone.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Finish it!」</p>

<p>　I approach, wondering where to slash next.</p>

<p>　Then, the mount dragon said, 『Gyuaaaaaah!』 a high-pitched squeal that I had never heard before.</p>

<p>I was wondering what the hell was hmming, and one after another, wizard-type monsters appeared through the cracks in the rock shell of the mount dragon and surrounded me.</p>

<p>“…… come to think of it, you guys were in on it, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>　I was originally in the belly of the mount dragon because of the black-robed wizard. These guys had a cooperative symbiotic relationship with the dragons.</p>

<p>　The dragon provides a comfortable home away from the enemy, and the wizards provide fresh food for the dragon’s body and catch.　A tag team that no other monster can compete with.</p>

<p>『Gigi ……!』</p>

<p>　The wizards look at me and smile. They all look like they don’t expect to lose.</p>

<p>　But still, ……, it’s annoying. I’m trying to get home on time, and you’re getting in my way.</p>

<p>“You guys are going to be my next opponent, ……?　I’ll end this as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>「You look so scary!」</p>

<p>「All office workers who are trying to leave on time have this look on their faces.」</p>

<p>「This is a top-notch corporate warrior.」</p>

<p>「Even the wizards are scared.」</p>

<p>「A working man is a strong man.」</p>

<p>「He’s a company man who works 350 hours of overtime a month. He’s got a different look.」</p>

<p>　I regained my grip on my sword and slashed at the wizards.</p>
