<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>『Giggi!』</p>

<p>　Wizard-type monsters with wands are coming toward me.</p>

<p>　There are fire-robed wizards, black-robed wizards, thunder-robed wizards, white-robed wizards, and various other types of wizards. There are various kinds of monsters: fire-robed magicians, black-robed magicians, thunder-robed magicians, white-robed clergymen, and so on.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　All of them are of rank S. They are troublesome opponents.</p>

<p>　Unless you know how to deal with them.</p>

<p>『Giiii!』</p>

<p>　The flame-robed wizard creates a huge fireball with the tip of his staff.</p>

<p>　A high-temperature flame that could melt steel. But it doesn’t actually radiate heat while it is at the tip of the staff.</p>

<p>　The body of a magician-type monster is a robe. Naturally, they are weak against fire. Therefore, to prevent their bodies from burning, when there is a flame near them, they put a film of magical power around the flame.</p>

<p>　So when they are not shooting flames, it is safe to approach them.</p>

<p>“Let me interrupt you.”</p>

<p>『Giii！？』</p>

<p>　The flame-robed wizard shouts in surprise as I step into his bosom at once.</p>

<p>　If you get this close, the flame-robed wizard will have no way to attack you. He tried to get out of the way quickly, but the sword flashed before he could do so.</p>

<p>『Gii……iii！？』</p>

<p>　The red robe is cut to pieces at the same time as the sword flashes.</p>

<p>　The body of the flame-robed sorcerer dissipates and disappears as the robe of the main body is cut off.</p>

<p>「It’s too fast, I can’t see anything.」</p>

<p>「I got the world’s scariest ‘I’m interrupting you’.」</p>

<p>「Door-to-door salesman of death.」</p>

<p>「Wow, it’s surprisingly easy to get close like that.」</p>

<p>「Normally, you’d be burned to cinders before you could get that close.」</p>

<p>「Well, no one can do it but Shachiken, …….」</p>

<p>『Giii ……!』</p>

<p>　The other wizards, perhaps in a hurry because their friends disappeared into dust, hurriedly tried to distance themselves from me.</p>

<p>　It is troublesome if they keep their distance from me. I picked up the staff of the flame-robed wizard, which still had a fireball in it, and threw it at the wizards.</p>

<p>　The fireball is now covered by a film that has disappeared because the flame-robed wizard has vanished. The fireball hits the ground with all its might and causes a huge explosion, engulfing the wizards in flames.</p>

<p>『GiiGii！？』</p>

<p>　The wizards panic as their robes catch fire.</p>

<p>　They can’t use magic anymore. I approach one by one and kill them all with a simple “ei, ei” (Tl: A small grunting sound before doing something physical. I hate SFXs, I really do)</p>

<p>『Gyaaaa』</p>

<p>『Gyaaaa』</p>

<p>「They’re being processed like line work.」</p>

<p>「Is that really an S-rank monster?」</p>

<p>「Mount Dragon-kun is pulling behind you, too.」</p>

<p>「No, I’m in love with that one. …… No, I’m just a bit nervous.」</p>

<p>「How can my symbiotic partner be so easily beaten?」</p>

<p>「Is this a light novel?」 (Tl:  close, a webnovel)</p>

<p>「Shachiken, ‘did I do something again?’」</p>

<p>「It’s rare when you don’t do something.」</p>

<p>　After defeating all the wizards that came at me, I sheathe my sword and look at the mount dragon.</p>

<p>　Now all I have to do is defeat this guy and my business is done. Now, as I’m thinking …… about how I’m going to deal with this big fella, the mount dragon suddenly turns its back and starts running away.</p>

<p>“Oh, hey!”</p>

<p>「It’s running away, lmao.」</p>

<p>「It can’t help it. Even I would run away.」</p>

<p>「Dragons run away……?」</p>

<p>「Oh, but that direction is…」</p>

<p>「Oh, by the way, there’s Yui over there…」</p>

<p>「Oh no. I completely forgot about her.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Hurry up!」</p>

<p>　I noticed Hoshino in the comments and ran as fast as I could.</p>

<p>　I looked over and saw Hoshino standing right where the mount dragon had fled.</p>

<p>『Gaaaah!』</p>

<p>“Hi-hi!”</p>

<p>　With a roar, the mount dragon bared its fangs.</p>

<p>　It was probably its intention to get rid of at least one of them. Seeing this, Hoshino was completely frightened and made no move…….</p>

<p>　Hoshino was facing the mount dragon head-on with the great sword at her back. She didn’t seem to intend to run away.</p>

<p>「Yui, you can’t do that, no matter how much you want to!」</p>

<p>「Run away, Yui!」</p>

<p>「You’ll end up getting trampled!」</p>

<p>「Shachiken hurry up!」</p>

<p>　The comments were filled with voices worried about Hoshino.</p>

<p>　I should probably run like hell right now and stop the mount dragon, but that would mean stepping on Hoshino’s determination. But that would be trampling on Hoshino’s resolve.</p>

<p>　That’s how serious her eyes were.</p>

<p>　Hoshino made eye contact with me and nodded slowly. To me, it looked like she was saying, “Leave this to me”. Then there was only one thing I could say.</p>

<p>“Yui!　Go all out!”</p>

<p>“……!　Yes!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino, smiling happily, grips her greatsword with both hands and confronts the oncoming mount dragon.</p>

<p>　The mount dragon showed no mercy and tried to bite Hoshino with its large fangs.</p>

<p>「What are you doing, Shachiken!」</p>

<p>「Yui, run away!」</p>

<p>「It’s over!」</p>

<p>「You missed it, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「I’ll cut off the stream the moment you start bleeding.」</p>

<p>「Don’t worry, the moment the splatter footage is shown, the AI will decide to shut down the stream.」</p>

<p>　The comments section was filled with a funeral mood, but Hoshino’s eyes were alive.</p>

<p>　She firmly stepped on the ground and readied her sword just as I had taught her.</p>

<p>“Concentrate all your energy with a “wham” and step forward with a “plop”. Shoulders should be open with a “poof” and back should be straight. Send power through the legs and into the body with a “squeezing” motion. ……” (I’ll just let the bot do whatever it wants with these SFXs, after all, even the commenters can’t understand them)</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s body was filled with power.</p>

<p>　When it comes to physical talent alone, Hoshino is more gifted than me. What she lacks now is experience and knowledge.</p>

<p>　Now that I’ve taught her the knowledge, she should be much stronger than she was before.</p>

<p>“Grip the sword firmly ……!　”Zun!”　”Pow!”.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino uses all her strength to slam her greatsword into the head of the mount dragon.</p>

<p>　The attack, launched at an angle, shook the mount dragon’s head violently. Instead of striking from the front, she countered by striking at an angle, successfully covering the difference in weight. That one works.</p>

<p>「The Mount Dragon is staggering!」</p>

<p>「Seriously, Yui!」</p>

<p>「Yaba, the wife of a fighting tribe!」</p>

<p>「 Power No. 1 and Power No. 2!」</p>

<p>「They’re a couple of physical monsters!」</p>

<p>「Shachiken has raised a hell of a guy. ……」</p>

<p>『Ga……a……?』</p>

<p>　The  Mount dragon wobbles after a painful counterattack.</p>

<p>　I take the opportunity to jump on his back.</p>

<p>“It’s almost closing time. Let’s finish this.”</p>

<p>『G……Gaaaah!』</p>

<p>　The mount dragon regains consciousness, notices me on his back, and tries to bite me.</p>

<p>　But I had already seen the weakness of the mount dragon.</p>

<p>”—-, one shot.”</p>

<p>　I raised my sword and aimed it at the slight opening in the shell of the mount dragon.</p>

<p>　I don’t want to slash it again and again. With a single blow, I decide it.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-Style kenjutsu Fugaku Karatakewari.”</p>

<p>　Drawing an arc, my sword slams into the back of the mount dragon.</p>

<p>　The blow that I struck at the weakest point slices the huge mount dragon’s body cleanly in half.</p>

<p>『Gah……a?』</p>

<p>　The mount dragon, not knowing what had happened, died.</p>

<p>　I check my watch as I fly away from the collapsing scaffolding and mutter.</p>

<p>“17:27, business is over. —- I guess I can sleep today.”</p>
