<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“It’s 18:17…… a little past the regular time, but that’s about right.”</p>

<p>　I returned safely to the entrance of the dungeon and muttered to myself as I looked at my watch.</p>

<p>　It took me a little over 30 minutes to get back from the deep level. It was probably fast enough. I didn’t fight any monsters on the way back, so I shouldn’t be in the business.</p>

<p>　But instead, I ran so fast that Hoshino, who was being held by me, got a little woozy.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>“Ha, yes. ……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino slapped herself in the face and regained her composure.</p>

<p>　A lot has happened today, even so,…… it’s my first stream and I had two or three changes from the plan. It was supposed to be a leisurely stream in the middle level. How did it come to this?</p>

<p>“Well, folks. Thank you for watching this far. Now that we are safely back on the ground, I would like to end the stream now.”</p>

<p>　Adachi had taught me that it was important to give a closing speech, so I bowed in front of the drone.</p>

<p>　Then the comments started pouring in at a blistering pace.</p>

<p>「That was fun, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「Thank you so much for your hard work!」</p>

<p>「I used to be an anti-fan, but now I’m a fan!」</p>

<p>「Please marry me!」</p>

<p>「I wish you and Yui all the best!」</p>

<p>「［¥3000］I’ll definitely go see the next one!」</p>

<p>「I’ll be waiting for you, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「［¥5000］Shachiken is the best!」</p>

<p>「[¥12,800] Here’s some money for the date. Please accept this.」</p>

<p>　Seeing the warm words flying in one after another, I was moved to the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>　Thinking back, I never received any praise or recognition from anyone while working at the Black Dog Guild.</p>

<p>　I’m really glad I quit.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your warm words and spacha(Tl: Super chat, but I won’t bother change it , has a nice ring). See you all on the next stream.”</p>

<p>　And with that, I properly ended the stream this time.</p>

<p>　I looked at it twice and it was properly terminated. I look at …… one more time just in case.</p>

<p>“This is all right, right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I checked it myself, and it was shut down properly.”</p>

<p>“If Hoshino says it’s okay, it’s okay.”</p>

<p>　I’ll have to fix my internet incompetence somehow.</p>

<p>　This is going to be the main battleground from now on.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that. I’ll ask Adachi for advice on this.</p>

<p>“Good work, Hoshino. I’m amazed that you’ve made it this far without making a single complaint. You’ve only been an explorer for a short time.”</p>

<p>“No, no!　It’s all thanks to you, Mr. Tanaka!　I would have died many times on my own. I am really grateful……!　Thank you very much!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino bowed her head so vigorously that it looked as if her head would hit the ground.</p>

<p>“It is natural for explorers to help each other. It seems the viewers enjoyed the show thanks to the accident, so you don’t have to worry about it.”</p>

<p>“No,　I will definitely return the favor!”</p>

<p>　The pushy Hoshino pushes me to accept it, and I say, “Wow, okay, okay.”</p>

<p>　It’s nice to be appreciated, but you don’t have to worry too much about it. It’s a waste of time to waste time on this old man.</p>

<p>“Anyway, let’s go upstairs. The elevator is …… still broken. Did the explorers who escaped climb the cliff on their own?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it. Shall we climb up too?</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. Oh, just in time. Let me show you how to walk vertically on the wall.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?　Please!”</p>

<p>　I explain lightly how to grip the wall with the soles of my feet.</p>

<p>“Squeeze the wall with the soles of your feet like this. The trick is to keep your back straight.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it difficult with shoes on?”</p>

<p>“You have to grip the surface with your shoes. Here, try it.”</p>

<p>“Like this?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes. You’re good.”</p>

<p>　Though still awkward, Hoshino succeeded in taking two steps up the wall.</p>

<p>　I was right after all. I’m sure she’ll be able to learn it in no time.</p>

<p>“Mwu……, it’s not that easy, is it?”</p>

<p>“No problem. With practice, you’ll get it right away. What do you think?　Shall I carry you up to the top for today?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about that. …… No, please.”</p>

<p>　I thought she was going to say no, but to my surprise, Hoshino jumped on me saying that.</p>

<p>　The fact that the softness of the material against my body and the smell of it are not very good for my mental health. I endured it with the mental strength of steel.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s …… nothing. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>　I walk along the wall with Hoshino in my arms.</p>

<p>　After a few minutes of walking, I reach the ground level where the elevator is located. And then..,</p>

<p>“Here it comes!　It’s Shachiken!　Yui’s here too!”</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>　There were a lot of people waiting there, all pointing their phones at me at once and snapping pictures. I’m doing okay thanks to the people who seem to be from the Administration Bureau holding me down, but if they weren’t there, I would have been jostled by the people.</p>

<p>　As we were standing there wondering what to do after dropping Hoshino off, a person came up to us.</p>

<p>“……Should I say thank you for your hard work?”</p>

<p>“What?　Why are you here?”</p>

<p>　The person who spoke to me was my old friend, Amatsuki Kanade, the section chief of the Demon Subjugation Bureau’s First Division.</p>

<p>On her waist was her beloved sword, “Saya”. It seems that she came here with a battle in mind.</p>

<p>　The cause of the anomaly in the dungeon, the mount dragon, had been defeated. The dungeon will be back to normal soon.</p>

<p>“…… yeah, I know. I was watching the stream, too. I saw you slaughtering monsters one after another just as you used to do, and I saw you flirting with the young girls there.” (Tl: Assert your dominance first heroine (ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ┻━┻)</p>

<p>　Saying this, Amatsuki quietly glared at Hoshino.</p>

<p>　Poor Hoshino let out a frightened “hiccup”.</p>

<p>“She’s simply got caught up in an unusual situation. I don’t feel bothered either, so please tolerate me.”</p>

<p>“As usual, you’re a dullard or something. I don’t blame the girl. I will ask you later about what happened in the dungeon, but that is all. My men will take you to your home today. I’m sure it will be difficult with all the people here.”</p>

<p>　As Amatsuki says this, a female subordinate in a suit comes to Hoshino. Amatsuki’s subordinate would be safe to entrust her with the job. It’s best to leave it to her.</p>

<p>“See you later, Hoshino. Let’s meet again when you get a chance.”</p>

<p>“…… Yes. Thank you so much for your help. I will never forget today!</p>

<p>　Hoshino said so exaggeratedly, bowed her head, and left.</p>

<p>　I have a feeling that Hoshino and I are going to be friends for a long time.</p>

<p>“Amatsuki is going to investigate inside now?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sure it’s safe inside now, so I’ll leave the investigation to my subordinates. I’m busy, so I’m heading to another site.”</p>

<p>　Amatsuki’s eyes were slightly tired as he said this.</p>

<p>　She was not as tired as I was when I was a corporate employee, but she seemed to be working very hard.</p>

<p>“Don’t push yourself too hard, okay?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure if you’re the one to say that ……. You are that kind of person, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>　Amatsuki’s cold gaze contains a slight glimpse of her old, kind eyes, but she quickly returns them to their usual look.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I have a lot to talk to you about, so I will visit your house later on. Don’t run away. The minister wants to see you too.</p>

<p>“The minister is …… Mr. Dojima?”</p>

<p>“Who else would it be?”</p>

<p>　Amatsuki said in disgust.</p>

<p>　I’m an old acquaintance of Ryuichiro Dojima, the minister of the Ministry of Demon Control. I like the man, but the thought of meeting the minister makes me nervous and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Anyway!　I will visit you again, so be prepared for anything.”</p>

<p>　With that, Amatsuki leaves.</p>

<p>　I was worried about whether she was getting paid for her overtime work.</p>

<p>“I should go home too, …….”</p>

<p>　I was about to leave as usual when a crowd of people started to crowd towards me.</p>

<p>　I jumped up and down and disappeared into the city at night.</p>
