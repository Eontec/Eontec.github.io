<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“The day after my first stream, I woke up at noon.”</p>

<p>“Huh …… slept well.”</p>

<p>　I rub my eyes and wake up dozing.</p>

<p>　This is the moment when I feel happiest after quitting my job. When I was a corporate employee, I couldn’t sleep like this without worrying about the time. My phone still has a timer set to go off every five minutes.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“There is nothing in particular to do today, so I’m just going to slack off. ……”</p>

<p>　I fiddle with my phone and check the social media sites.</p>

<p>　The social networking site that I registered under my real name already has over 600,000 followers. I don’t tweet much, but the ……D tube effect is amazing.</p>

<p>“Let’s see……… 『Good morning. Let’s have a good day』.”</p>

<p>　I mumble a few random words on social networking sites.</p>

<p>　I know it’s no use mumbling such things, but Adachi told me, “It doesn’t matter if it’s boring, just mumble often. I’ve been instructed by Adachi, “It doesn’t matter if it’s boring, just tweet often and write what you’re thinking,” so I’ve been obedient.</p>

<p>　I’ve never followed or promoted anyone, so I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>“Oh …… got a quick reply.”</p>

<p>「Ohayo shachiken!」</p>

<p>「Ohayooooooo!」</p>

<p>「I’m glad you’re getting lots of sleep.」</p>

<p>「Oh, good morning, Shachiken!　Did you have a good dream?」</p>

<p>「When is the next stream?　How long do I have to stay naked?」</p>

<p>　Everyone replies happily.</p>

<p>　This might be a little fun. I’d like to reply to each of them one by one, but Adachi tells me not to do that because I’d lose my edge. So I quietly just “like” them.</p>

<p>“…… hmm?　This one.”</p>

<p>　As I check the replies, I see a familiar name among them.</p>

<p>　It was Hoshino Yui, the person I saved yesterday. She had replied to me on her account for D-tubers.</p>

<p>「Thank you so much for yesterday!　Thanks to you, I was able to return home safely. I will thank you next time ✨」</p>

<p>　Hoshino had politely replied to me.</p>

<p>　I succinctly said, “I’m glad you made it home safely. You don’t have to thank me too much,” I’m not sure how much I’m going to be able to do with this.</p>

<p>“I think it’s this kind of accumulation that leads to popularity. It’s easy compared to working for a company. I have to do this well.”</p>

<p>　While I was busy with my social networking activities, a message suddenly came in the mail.</p>

<p>　The sender was Adachi. Well, he’s the only one who knows my address.</p>

<p>“Uh, what is it, ……?”</p>

<p>『Thanks for yesterday’s stream!　I want to congratulate you on the successful stream and talk about future streaming activities, so let’s go out to dinner tonight!　I’ll attach the place and time to your message.』</p>

<p>　That’s what Adachi’s message said.</p>

<p>　He was as selfish as ever. I wonder what he was going to do if I had plans.</p>

<p>　I don’t have any plans for …… after today, but…</p>

<p>The place …… is a pretty good BBQ restaurant. The last time we went to a family restaurant, but this is a great deal of money.</p>

<p>At the mention of the word “ BBQ,” my stomach rumbled.</p>

<p>I haven’t had BBQ at a restaurant for a while now. I’ve been wanting to eat it for a long time.</p>

<p>“I’m going to kill some time until nighttime. It would be nice to sleep one more time. ……”</p>

<p>　Saying this, I lay down again.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure if I’ve had a second sleep in nearly a decade.</p>

<p>“I’m going to go back to sleep.”</p>

<p>　My vision is closing, and my consciousness slowly faded away.</p>

<p>　I fell into a comfortable slumber and went back to sleep for the first time in I don’t know how long.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>“Hey Tanaka!　Yesterday was great!”</p>

<p>　Night.</p>

<p>　I went to the BBQ restaurant that Adachi had instructed me to go to, and there I found Adachi in a good mood.</p>

<p>　He looked very happy even though he had not drunk yet.</p>

<p>“You look so happy, What kind of twist is this…… to even set up such a nice barbecue restaurant?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m a little bit excited. After all, you had 700,000 subscribers on your first stream, didn’t you?　There was a problem with the unusual situation, but it was resolved without incident, and because of that, it became a social networking service and an Internet news source, so it was truly a blessing in disguise. You did a great job.”</p>

<p>　Adachi speaks smoothly.</p>

<p>　It seems he is pleased with my success.</p>

<p>　He often says unnecessary things, but I’ve always found him to be surprisingly friendly.</p>

<p>“Spachas are doing well, too. Look at this.”</p>

<p>“Hmm?　Which one is ……,Eeeeeh!”</p>

<p>　The smartphone Adachi showed me a ridiculous amount of money.</p>

<p>It’s higher than my annual income when I was a corporate employee. …… Did I earn this in a single day?</p>

<p>“You’re going to have to pay a lot of taxes on this year’s tax return. We’re going to have to eat expensive meat and write it off as an expense.”</p>

<p>“I see. I see. So you have to think about taxes when you are a freelancer. I’m not familiar with that area, so thank you.”</p>

<p>I’ll take care of the details. I’ll take care of the details. You can go on your merry way in the dungeon as usual.</p>

<p>　Adachi said dependably.</p>

<p>　That’s what he does best. I’ll be happy to leave it to him.</p>

<p>“Let’s order up some meat. Let’s eat a lot of meat.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Then, be my guest.”</p>

<p>　I called the waiter and started ordering.</p>

<p>“Thirty servings of ribs, twenty servings of loin, ten servings of tongue, and twenty servings of Skirt steak. And five large servings of rice, please.”</p>

<p>Hey, you’re asking too much!　That’s too much to ask!　I’m going to pay for it today!</p>

<p>　Adachi protested, but I ordered more.</p>

<p>　Barbeque has to be free. No one is allowed to stop my appetite.</p>

<p>“I underestimated the appetite of an awakened person.”</p>

<p>“You are an awakened person too, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>　I tried to argue with him, but he shook his head and went “yare, yare”</p>

<p>　You son of a bitch. I’m going eat until your wallet is empty.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: We’ve officially caught up with the author, which isn’t bad, because I’m also going back to school this week(Wish I didn’t need this degree). Slowing down isn’t really a bad idea, unless I pick up another novel… 
Really in line with the title of the chapter… 
Edit literally before basically any of you even saw it: The author has posted two more chapters on another site, maybe she’ll add them to syosetu later, maybe she won’t, translation continues</p>
