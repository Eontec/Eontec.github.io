<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Un~n, delicious~♡”</p>

<p>　With a happy look on her face, Hoshino was putting meat into her stomach one piece after another.</p>

<p>　Her speed is almost as fast as an adult. And even though she is fast, she eats beautifully and her mouth is clean.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　I was determined not to let her speed get the better of me, so I started to eat the meat one after the other.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve eaten yakiniku. I’ve never been to such a nice restaurant and I wish I could have …… fed it to my family.” (Tl: Yakiniku = BBQ)</p>

<p>“If so, you can buy a bento and take it home. I believe it’s on the menu.”</p>

<p>“What?　Is it really okay for me to do that?”</p>

<p>“It’s only natural. It’s okay, isn’t it, Adachi?”</p>

<p>I asked, to which Adachi replied in a burnt-out tone, “It’s okay to ask for a bento……”.  I certainly don’t remember how many servings I’ve already eaten. I’ve already eaten my first order, and I’ve ordered three more.</p>

<p>“Well. Here, let’s order the best one. You can take more home with you.”</p>

<p>“Uh …… thank you so much first of all ……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said in a voice that sounded as if she was about to start crying.</p>

<p>　It seems she was really happy about it.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>　I stoped the store clerk and ordered an additional bento.</p>

<p>　The young woman at the store, who had finished listening to my order, asks me shyly,</p>

<p>“Oh, um, you are …… Shachiken, right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. “</p>

<p>　When I answered, her face lit up.</p>

<p>“I knew it!　I’m a fan!　I was surprised to meet you at a place like this!　Um, may I shake your hand or something?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>　The clerk pushed me to shake her hand.</p>

<p>　I never thought the day would come when I would be asked to shake hands. …… The clerk seemed happy, and I must really be famous.</p>

<p>“Um. If you don’t mind, can I have a picture…?”</p>

<p>　I looked at Adachi as if I was in trouble.</p>

<p>　We had not yet discussed how much fan service I could provide. I had not yet told him how much fan service I was allowed to do.</p>

<p>“You can take as many pictures as you want. Yes, you can put your autograph in the store. Now’s the time to make a name for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Autographs, you mean, ……, do you want those?”</p>

<p>　When I questioned her about it, the clerk interrupted me with a loud, “Oh, I want it! I want it!” The shopkeeper interrupted me with a loud voice.</p>

<p>　Oh, really? I wasn’t thinking of signing anything.</p>

<p>“Oh, Adachi.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t thought of a signature design, have you?　Don’t worry, I’m not looking for a stylish signature. All you have to do is write ‘Makoto Tanaka’ as politely as your signature.”</p>

<p>“Is that okay ……?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s perfect. She’s waiting for you.”</p>

<p>　Adachi urged me to get up from my seat.</p>

<p>　Even so, until recently, I had nothing but to be abused by others, so I signed a handshake… I really don’t know what will happen in life.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>　――――The private room afterTanaka leftt.</p>

<p>　The two left there were Hoshino and Adachi.</p>

<p>“…………”</p>

<p>　Hoshino was munching on her meat without making a sound.</p>

<p>　She was relaxed when Tanaka was there, but not so when Adachi was alone with her. She is a cheerful and sociable person, but being alone with an adult man she doesn’t know very well was awkward for her.</p>

<p>　To distract herself from this, she kept putting the meat in her mouth and eating it, and then suddenly Adachi spoke up.</p>

<p>“So, Yui, how serious are you about Tanaka?”</p>

<p>“Buhuhu!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino was surprised by Adachi’s unexpected words.</p>

<p>　She almost blurted out what was in her mouth, but she used her feminine strength to hold it back.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I’m not Tanaka. I know from your stream that you have feelings for Tanaka. So I want you to tell me the honest truth.”</p>

<p>“…………”</p>

<p>　Hoshino pondered for a while and then slowly opened her mouth.</p>

<p>‘Well,…… I really don’t know right now. But …… I do want to get to know him better than I do now. I would be happy if I could make you feel even a little more special…” (Tl: Tch. Where’s the first heroine when ou need her?)</p>

<p>　Looking at Hoshino with her cheeks flushed, Adachi said happily “I see”</p>

<p>“Well, if she’s a good girl like Yui, I’ll be at ease too.　He’s been working so long that his self-esteem has dropped to the bottom of the barrel. He thinks he’s an old man because he’s been working for so long. He won’t even realize you like him unless you attack him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino says with a serious expression.</p>

<p>　Seeing this, Adachi smiled satisfactorily, then drank the contents of the mug in his hand and emptied it.</p>

<p>“I want him to be happy. But I’m not strong enough, and I’m a man, so I can’t support him or protect him, but you can. To be honest, I envy you.” (Tl: At this point isn’t there supposed to be a yaoi tag? or am I missing something?)</p>

<p>　Hearing Adachi’s words, Hoshino’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>

<p>“Adachi-san, could it be ……?” (Tl: She thinks the same lmao)</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to be misunderstood, okay?　 The only thing is that I sometimes feel that way when I look at that exhausted guy.”</p>

<p>“Is that so ……? You really are a good friend, aren’t you, Adachi-san?”</p>

<p>“Right? Oh, don’t tell Tanaka what I just said, okay?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino nodded at those words.</p>

<p>　Then, just in time, Tanaka came back into the private room.</p>

<p>“I signed my name like crazy. ……”</p>

<p>“Oh, the popular man is back. Here you go, eat the rest of the food quickly. You can have Yui feed it to you if you want.”</p>

<p>“What a stupid …… thing to say, Hoshino, you really don’t have to do this!”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t worry about it!”</p>

<p>“Hahaha, that’s nice. I never get tired of watching you guys.”</p>

<p>　And so the three of them continued their pleasant dinner party until late into the night.</p>
