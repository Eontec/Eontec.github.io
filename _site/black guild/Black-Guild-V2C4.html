<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>「Kyaaaaaaa!!　I’m going to fall down!」</p>

<p>「I’m going to die!　I’m going to die!」</p>

<p>「I’ve fallen before. I’m already used to it.」</p>

<p>「Is this your first time streaming Shachiken?　Relax,」
<!--more--></p>

<p>「No one’s used to it.」</p>

<p>「I’m going to have to take a motion sickness pill.」</p>

<p>「This is really going to kill me!　I don’t care how sturdy the awakened are, if they fall at this speed, they’re going to die!」</p>

<p>　I confirm that the comments are flowing at a blazing speed while I’m falling.</p>

<p>　I don’t know what it is, but they seem to be getting excited. Looks like I was right to jump in.</p>

<p>“Time to slow down.”</p>

<p>　As the bottom gradually appears in sight, I pull out the single-edged sword at my waist.</p>

<p>　I thrust it into the cliff and put my foot on the back of the blade. It’s like skateboarding in shape. But it’s not snow that he’s skating on, it’s a cliff.</p>

<p>“Here goes ……!”</p>

<p>　After slowing down enough, I kick the cliff and jump up.</p>

<p>　Then, after spinning a few degrees in the air, I land with a thud. I’m used to this kind of acrobatic movement since I used to jump around in dungeons to fulfill endless quotas when I was a corporate slave.</p>

<p>「Muu, I’m dizzy …….」</p>

<p>「I thought I was going to die just looking at it.」</p>

<p>「It was so exciting!　I wish I could be an awakened person too, to be able to move around like this!」</p>

<p>「No, a normal awakened person can’t move around like this.　If they could, there wouldn’t be an elevator here.」</p>

<p>「*But only if you’re Tanaka. I don’t think it’s like this for others.」</p>

<p>　The response to the comments has been positive.</p>

<p>　It was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let’s get right into the ‘Nishi-Shinjuku Cliff Dungeon. There may be some things I wouldn’t like to show you, but I hope you enjoy it.”</p>

<p>「You’re so fucking polite, Kusa.」</p>

<p>「You’re soaked in company spirit.」</p>

<p>「But I like it because a lot of streamers are rude.」</p>

<p>「I get it. It makes me feel comfortable.」</p>

<p>「It’s okay to be like this.」</p>

<p>「It’s normal and it makes me feel safe.」</p>

<p>「Wait a minute. You forgot he just jumped off a cliff!　He’s not normal!」</p>

<p>　I step into the dungeon with the comments behind me.</p>

<p>　There are exceptions, but basically, the dungeon continues underground. The walls are like caves, hollowed out of earth and rock, and some of them are like ruins.</p>

<p>　The most important feature is that there are monsters in the dungeon.</p>

<p>　Basically, monsters live only inside the dungeon, but occasionally some of them come out. In such cases, Amatsuki’s office is contacted first, and the staff there goes to defeat the monsters.</p>

<p>　While I was thinking about that……, the monsters were on their way.</p>

<p>『Gigi, gigi …….』</p>

<p>　The green-skinned monsters, known as “goblins,” came with a shrill voice.</p>

<p>　Although they use knives and other weapons, they are not intelligent or physically strong at all.</p>

<p>　They are ranked D by the Association of Explorers, which is the lowest danger level.</p>

<p>　There were five goblins in all.</p>

<p>　There weren’t that many of them, and it didn’t look like it would be a good time to take a picture of them.</p>

<p>“Yo!”</p>

<p>　I stepped lightly and passed by the goblins.</p>

<p>　A moment later, I swung my sword. The goblins were all in the same position.</p>

<p>『Gee……?』</p>

<p>　The goblins crumpled to the ground, not even realizing what had happened.</p>

<p>　They probably couldn’t even catch sight of me with their eyes. Now, hurry up and go to the middle level and make the sights……</p>

<p>「What?　What did you just do?」</p>

<p>「I couldn’t see you at all!」</p>

<p>「I’m a B-rank explorer and I really didn’t see it. I’m losing confidence ……」</p>

<p>「The camera’s performance is not good enough. I can’t see it even if I view it frame by frame. When did he move?」</p>

<p>「This is a defeat of human technology, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「The camera can’t see him?　I’ve got an idea.」</p>

<p>「Officer, this is the guy.」 (Tl: Oh my God I’m crying(<em>≧艸≦</em>))</p>

<p>　With a ding, I sheathe my sword, and the comments are very noisy.</p>

<p>　Apparently, they’re getting excited about my current move.</p>

<p>　Hmmm. The opponent was a goblin, not an opponent that anyone would have a hard time against. People who aren’t explorers are watching, but don’t they know that what they’ve just seen isn’t great?</p>

<p>“Um, I’m glad you’re happy, but that was just a goblin, so it’s no big deal. You can do that with a little practice.”</p>

<p>　When I explained that, the comments flowed at blast speed.</p>

<p>「I can’t do that!」</p>

<p>「I can take down a goblin too, but not like that. ……」</p>

<p>「 Are you saying I’m doing something wrong?」</p>

<p>「It’s hard to know if you’re serious or not.」</p>

<p>「Shachiken: “What? I just slashed him at a speed that even the camera can’t follow.” 」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　There’s a different monster coming!」</p>

<p>I noticed a large gray rat coming toward us.</p>

<p>　Is that a dungeon rat? It’s about as strong as a goblin, but it’s fast and above all, it stinks.</p>

<p>　If you get covered in its blood, you can’t get rid of the rotten smell for a while. I used to have a hard time with them.</p>

<p>　The comments were coming.</p>

<p>「Ugh, it’s a dungeon rat!」</p>

<p>「I don’t like the smell.」</p>

<p>　And the like.</p>

<p>　It seems that everyone has the same thought.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you a good way to beat the dungeon rat. It’s not that hard, and it won’t stink.”</p>

<p>「Is there such a method?」</p>

<p>「I want to hear it, I want to hear it!」</p>

<p>「I hope so!」</p>

<p>「It’s a lie, it’s definitely difficult.」</p>

<p>「Don’t say that, we already know」</p>

<p>　I look at the dungeon rat coming toward me and pull my sword out of its sheath at high speed.</p>

<p>　The sword flashes, and an invisible blade is released.</p>

<p>　It is a shockwave that occurs when the speed of sound is exceeded, a so-called high-speed shockwave. The blade, which I call the “flying blade,” cuts the dungeon rat in two and blows its body away.</p>

<p>　This way, I won’t get the stink on me.</p>

<p>　Now, what do you think of the reaction of the comments? I’m surprised that many people don’t know how to do this.　I hope it helps.</p>

<p>「It’s impossible after all!!」</p>

<p>「I knew it.」</p>

<p>「I knew it.」</p>

<p>「I knew.」</p>

<p>「You see…」</p>

<p>「Humans don’t normally produce shockwaves.」(Tl: This one is my faavourite)</p>

<p>「He worked for a very special company.」</p>

<p>「It would be fun to shoot something like that.」</p>

<p>「Awakened people can do that?」</p>

<p>「How could they?」</p>

<p>　For some reason, this was a different reaction than I had expected.</p>

<p>　Hmmm, why doesn’t it work like this? Should I change my approach?</p>

<p>　As I was thinking this, Adachi, as if he could see right through me, said, “That’s good. Keep it up.”</p>

<p>　I’m not sure, but if he says so, I’ll keep going a little longer.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to go into the middle level now, and I have a question box on social media, so if you have any questions, please ask them there.”</p>

<p>　I looked at the camera, which I was not used to doing, and went further into the dungeon.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: 4 today!! *pats myself on the back*</p>
