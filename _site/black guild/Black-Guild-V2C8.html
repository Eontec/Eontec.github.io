<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>「What the hell was that!　I seriously didn’t see anything!」</p>

<p>「Does that mean that you weren’t serious all along ……?」</p>

<p>「There’s a chance this one isn’t serious yet either.」</p>

<p>「 “You got a bad opponent”… I wish I could say the same… ……」
<!--more--></p>

<p>「I feel bad for the opponent.」</p>

<p>「What other kinds of swordsmanship do you have?」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Hold me!」</p>

<p>「I’m an old man, but when I look at Tanaka, my heart starts to race. Could this be ……?」</p>

<p>「It’s heart palpitations, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>　The comments were noisy, but I ran up to the woman I had saved.</p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>　The woman I saved, I think her name was Hoshino Yui?　She looked stunned, as if she had been scared to death. Her face was slightly red, and I was worried.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!　I’m fine!”</p>

<p>　She bit down with all her might, but she seemed to be fine.</p>

<p>　I wonder if she will be able to walk home on her own.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s a good idea to stay here for the time being. Let’s get back to the wall.”</p>

<p>“Okay, that’s fine!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino-san and I moved out of the way. The possibility of being attacked by a monster is high in an open area.</p>

<p>　As I moved, I glanced at the comments. Incidentally, I don’t need to look at my phone to check the comments, as the drone projects a small screen in the air.</p>

<p>「A young man and woman in a dungeon …… how could anything not happen ……」</p>

<p>「Is this an R18 stream!?　That’s a violation of the terms and conditions!」</p>

<p>「Tanakaaa!　Be gentle with her!」</p>

<p>「My Yui is ……」</p>

<p>「My Tanaka is ……」</p>

<p>「You’re the first one in the harem. Yay!」 (Tl: Second, second)</p>

<p>「Now Japan, because of the dungeon, the disparity in society has become so great that bigamy is now OK. It’s possible to have a harem.」</p>

<p>「In the past, it wouldn’t have been possible, but that’s the trend worldwide. Old men can’t keep up.」</p>

<p>　The comments said whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>　I wouldn’t even touch her. I’m at least five years older than this girl. From her point of view, I must look like an old man. (Tl: 25 and 20)</p>

<p>　She seems like a nice girl, so she may feel indebted to me, but romantic feelings are different from that.</p>

<p>I’m sure I won’t see her again after I leave here.</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s take a break here.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to take care of your injuries now, so I’m going to cut off the stream for a while. We’ll resume in a little while.”</p>

<p>「Oi, wait a minuite.」</p>

<p>「Money!　I’ll give you money!」</p>

<p>「It’s my last day of life!」</p>

<p>「That’s not true, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>　Click.</p>

<p>　I ignore the stream of comments and mercilessly cut off the feed.</p>

<p>　It would be hard for her to talk to me if I was streaming. It’s a natural thing to do.</p>

<p>“Hoshino-san, it was ……, wasn’t it? I’m going to treat your injury, so could you tell me where it hurts?”</p>

<p>Oh, yes!　I’m sorry, you have been a huge help to me with everything. …… Thank you very much for your help!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino-san bowed her head with an apologetic look on her face, almost as if she were going to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>“If Tanaka-san hadn’t come, I would have died there. I will never forget this debt of gratitude!　I will definitely repay you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind. It’s only normal for me to help my colleagues.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not!　No, that’s not how it works!　I was raised by a mother who told me to repay a favor twice as much as I owed it!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino-san says with a sparkling face.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure how to describe her, but she’s a …… “yang” kind of girl. I’m a “yin” guy, so I’m dazzled by her.</p>

<p>　I may have had a little of this in me in the past, but I’ve turned completely black in my long life as a corporate slave.</p>

<p>　I just hope she doesn’t end up working for a black company.</p>

<p>“And Tanaka-san. I am younger than you and have much less experience as an explorer. So, could you please stop using honorifics?　It makes me feel a little bad.”</p>

<p>“Well, I understand ……. Then let’s be a little more informal.”</p>

<p>　We need to get out of this dungeon together.</p>

<p>　If we can’t stick to each other for any length of time, it’s not going to be easy to move. The best thing to do is to get to know each other at least for now.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,…… Hoshino. Where does it hurt?”</p>

<p>” It’s my leg. I got hit there by an ogre’s attack.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino put her foot in front of me as she sat down.</p>

<p>　 This looks painful.</p>

<p>“I understand. I’ll fix it now.”</p>

<p>　I take out a small bottle of green liquid from my suit pocket.</p>

<p>　I reach into my hand and apply it to her leg. Hoshino rolls her eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>“Is that a healing potion?　such a precious thing. ……”</p>

<p>“I still have more, so don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>“Ugh …… sorry …….”</p>

<p>　The recovery potion is a generic term for a liquid with restorative properties made from materials that can be found in dungeons.</p>

<p>　The most important thing to remember is that you can buy them for money on the surface, but they are …… quite expensive.</p>

<p>　Some guilds give them to you, but the guild I belonged to, of course, never gave them to me. So I had to make my own recovery medicine.</p>

<p>　Because I often dived deep into the depths, I was able to gather a lot of valuable materials. I had no trouble finding materials.</p>

<p>　It is forbidden to bring back materials without permission or to process and sell them in the dungeon, but it is legal to use the processed materials for oneself.</p>

<p>“Okay, that’s it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much!　The swelling has already gone down. …… It’s amazing!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino shows it by bouncing around on the spot.</p>

<p>　Each time she jumps, her large breasts sway, making it very hard to look at her. It’s a good thing I turned off the stream. ……</p>
