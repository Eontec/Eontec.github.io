<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　The day after the day I enjoyed yakiniku.</p>

<p>I was dressed in a suit and headed for the “Ministry of Monster Countermeasures” in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo.</p>

<p>“I’m sleepy.”</p>

<p>　I walk with a big yawn.</p>

<p>　I am very sleepy because I didn’t sleep well today.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure why, it’s not because I ate too much ……, it’s because of Amatsuki.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Even after one night, I still feel agony when I remember the feeling of kissing at a moment’s notice. I couldn’t sleep well today because of it.</p>

<p>“What am I, a junior high school student?”</p>

<p>　I muttered to myself, scratching my head.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure what to do about it, but it can’t be helped.　I’ve been so busy working that I’ve never experienced any kind of love life.</p>

<p>　I’ve been working all my life without even going to high school, so my experience with love is less than that of a high school student.</p>

<p>　It’s no wonder I’m in this state.</p>

<p>“It’s not some kind of misunderstanding is it?…….”</p>

<p>　It’s rude to suspect it’s a misunderstanding after letting Amatsuki get to that point.</p>

<p>　The most important thing to remember is that you can’t just take a chance on a new person and expect them to be your best friend.</p>

<p>　I’m sure she could have gotten someone much more handsome and worthwhile. What a waste.</p>

<p>　Well, I don’t feel bad about it…….</p>

<p>　The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good time with your friends and family. People on the street look at me funny, but I don’t care.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m here.”</p>

<p>The “Ministry of Monster Countermeasures” stands proudly by the Imperial Palace.</p>

<p>　This building, the cornerstone of national defense, is a very sturdy and magnificent structure.</p>

<p>　Today, I was summoned by the head of this organization, the minister of anti-demonology.</p>

<p>“He said there would be someone to meet me, but who?　Is it someone I know?”</p>

<p>　I move my gaze around in front of the Ministry of Demon Control.</p>

<p>　I was thinking that I had to find the pick-up person as soon as possible.</p>

<p>　She was a beautiful girl with clear blue eyes. She is about the same age as Hoshino?</p>

<p>　She has an expressionless, cool impression.</p>

<p>　Her outstanding good looks caught my attention, but what caught my attention was the way she walked.</p>

<p>　She has a beautiful walk with a strong, solid body.</p>

<p>　I could tell. She is not an amateur. She is a good warrior.</p>

<p>　As she approaches me, a thin smile appears on her pretty face.</p>

<p>　Unlike Hoshino, who is more of a small animal type, she has a mysterious charm that makes me a little nervous. As I wonder what on earth she wants from me, she says something I never imagined she would say.</p>

<p>“I was waiting for you, Sensei. It’s been a while.”</p>

<p>“Eh ……?”</p>

<p>　I nod my head in surprise.</p>

<p>　I’m sure I don’t know any silver-haired beauties like her.</p>

<p>　No, but didn’t this girl just call me “sensei”?</p>

<p>　I’m not sure if it’s possible for someone to call me that,…….</p>

<p>“Well, no way, Rin, is that you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You didn’t recognize me?”</p>

<p>　Saying that she, Ayagawa Rin, chuckles softly.</p>

<p>　The way she laughed was certainly the same as I remembered her laughing.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time!　Like five years?”</p>

<p>“To be exact, it’s been four years, ten months, three days, and two hours.”</p>

<p>　She was a former student of mine.</p>

<p>　I was once assigned as an instructor to a new recruit assigned to the Subjugation Unit as part of my job.</p>

<p>　It was a short six months, but I remember it was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>　Rin was one of the new recruits I took on at that time. At that time, she was only 14 years old or something.　She was a very talented girl, and her ability was superior to that of the other newcomers.</p>

<p>　She had been a cute girl since then, but I was surprised to see how much she had grown into a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>“I remember those days. Back then, you challenged me many times. Didn’t you challenge me about three hundred times?”</p>

<p>“To be precise, three hundred and forty-two times. I was inexperienced and didn’t know my place back then. There was no way that someone like me could compete with you.”</p>

<p>“You have changed, haven’t you? You really wanted to kill me back then.”</p>

<p>　Rin didn’t like the fact that I was the instructor, and she was just an old man with dead eyes, so she often challenged me to a duel.</p>

<p>　Each time, I fought back, pinned Rin down, and neutralized her.</p>

<p>　I thought she would give up after a few times, but Rin really did try again and again, and I remember I started to enjoy it.</p>

<p>　One day, however, Rin suddenly stopped challenging me.</p>

<p>　Then suddenly, she started to follow me around like a little puppy dog.</p>

<p>　I was happy because I thought she recognized me, but unfortunately, I went back to my normal work right after that.</p>

<p>　Since then I’ve been busy working again, and here I am.</p>

<p>“I saw an article saying you’re now the ace of the Subjugation Unit. I’m very proud of you”</p>

<p>“I owe it all to your guidance. If it weren’t for you breaking my pride, making me give in, and violating me, I wouldn’t be where I am today. ……” (Tl: A+ for the very implicative wording)</p>

<p>　Rin looked at me with a very humid gaze.</p>

<p>　No, I’m not sure how to say it. It’s as if I’ve done something wrong.</p>

<p>“Mm, I don’t mind talking about the old times, but could you show me in? Are you the one supposed to pick me up?”</p>

<p>“…… Yes, I understand. We’ll talk later. Then this way, please.”</p>

<p>　I was taken by Rin, who looked a little disappointed, and we stepped inside the Ministry of Monster Countermeasures.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: New Arc, New Heroine, Rui is acceptable plus she works (at the very least indirectly) under Amatsuki, so, the proper power dynamic already exists. Anyways, the poll is still up, vote on your favourite release schedule Poll will still be up till the end of the week.
