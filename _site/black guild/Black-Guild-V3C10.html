<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“I understand. Let’s call it a draw. …… haha.”</p>

<p>「Shachiken gave up lol」</p>

<p>「He’s going to have to hold a press conference to apologize.」</p>

<p>「This old man is really funny.」

「Is this what a minister looks like ……?」</p>

<p>「Hmm?　Is he coming closer?」</p>

<p>　Dojima-san moved away from me and went in front of the camera, this time for the stream.</p>

<p>　Then he stepped closer to the lens and began speaking in close-up.</p>

<p>“Tanaka, who is so strong that he could compete with me, is now a member of the Ministry of Monster Control!　Not only that, but I am now calling on the other four returnees from the Imperial Palace dungeon. The Ministry of Monster Control is going to get stronger and stronger from now on!”</p>

<p>　Mr. Dojima declared with pride.</p>

<p>　But even so, gathering the returnees is something out of the ordinary. What on earth is he trying to do?</p>

<p>“Are you watching?　Those damn foreigners who are after Japan’s dungeon resources. They seem to be up to all sorts of schemes. …… I won’t let them get away with it. If they come, come at me head on, and I’ll crush them as you wish.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san said to the camera as if he was trying to provoke it.</p>

<p>　Oh, so this is what he was aiming for.</p>

<p>　Japan is said to be a country of dungeons, with so many dungeons popping up all over the country.</p>

<p>　This means that there are a lot of dangers, but there are also a lot of resources to be gained. Thanks to this, other countries look up to us.</p>

<p>　However, because of this, there are many countries that target Japan. Dojima-san is not only dealing with dungeon problems, he is also dealing with those other countries.</p>

<p>　The reason he fought me was to show his power and check other countries.</p>

<p>　Minister Dojima’s strength is well known, but I’m sure many countries would back off if they knew seven such people were getting together.</p>

<p>「Fucking foreigners lol. Too cool.」</p>

<p>「If I were an enemy country, I’d back off.」</p>

<p>「The Oni Dojima is still alive and well, isn’t he?」</p>

<p>「I’m so excited that the returnees are gathering here, I wonder if some of them are coming who weren’t publicized because they’re underage.」</p>

<p>「…… didn’t he just say that Shachiken is a returnee too?　Did I mishear?」</p>

<p>「Hmm?」</p>

<p>「What?」</p>

<p>「Ah.」</p>

<p>「Really?」</p>

<p>「Oh, yeah, that’s what he said.」</p>

<p>「No way!」</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san’s voice leaked out as he looked at the comments.</p>

<p>　This guy……, did he just?</p>

<p>“Sheesh. This was a secret.”</p>

<p>　Mr. Dojima slaps himself on the head inadvertently.</p>

<p>　Can we pretend he didn’t just say that?　But this was a live stream. Naturally, there was no way to retract what he had said. Soon the comment section became noisy.</p>

<p>「Are you a returnee Shachiken!」</p>

<p>「You’re one of the real heroes!」</p>

<p>「Too bad!」</p>

<p>「Awww, the guy who said it was processed!」</p>

<p>「Three returnees in the government, that’s too bad. They’re overpowered.」</p>

<p>「I feel sorry for the gaijin I’m dealing with.」</p>

<p>「Seriously, why were you a company employee?」</p>

<p>「I thought you might be one of them.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　I want to send you a spacha, please stream it!」</p>

<p>「Anti-san, you’re getting overkilled!」</p>

<p>　The comments were so voluminous that it was hard to follow them with my eyes.</p>

<p>　At this rate, it’s going to be all over social networking sites and online news again. …… My head hurts.</p>

<p>“No, I’m really sorry, Tanaka. If that were the case, I will go poke all the viewers in the head and make their memories fly, okay?”</p>

<p>“What a thing to say, okay, you don’t have to do that. You don’t have to do that. You’re an adult now, so there’s no point in hiding it.”</p>

<p>“I see!　I’m sorry, I’m sorry. The older you get, the looser you become.”</p>

<p>　”Ha-ha-ha.”, Dojima-san laughs.</p>

<p>　I said it’s fine, but I’m sure it’s going to make a big fuss again, maybe for a D-tuber, but I’m not too happy about the fuss.</p>

<p>“Hah …… it’s going to be messy again ……”</p>

<p>　I thought about the future and became depressed all by myself.</p>
