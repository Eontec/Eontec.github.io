<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Uh, ……, I thought I was supposed to press here.”</p>

<p>“Right button, Minister.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this way.”</p>

<p>　The minister operated the camera and the stream ended.</p>

<p>　I never thought I’d have to fight with Dojima-san. I was tired, but …… well, it was a good experience.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Tanaka, for making you go through all of this. I’ll add some color to the job offer, so please forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind, Dojima-san. Thanks to you, the misunderstanding has been cleared up.”</p>

<p>　It would have been difficult to clear up the misunderstanding about the video processing by myself.</p>

<p>　I have Dojima-san to thank for that.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you think I won the match earlier?</p>

<p>“Of course not. I won that one.”</p>

<p>“You’re a stingy bastard, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san’s mouth is agape. He is really a competitive person who still cares about winning or losing.</p>

<p>　But this childishness is probably the reason why he is so well-liked.</p>

<p>　As I am thinking this, Kimura-san, the SP, comes up to me.</p>

<p>“I learned a great deal today. I realized how inexperienced I am.”</p>

<p>“It was a good match for me, too. I hope to see you again.”</p>

<p>　With that, I handed him my new business card as a D-tuber. Kimura-san also handed me his business card, saying, “Please contact me if you need anything.”</p>

<p>　Now I have connections with the Metropolitan Police Department. It seems like a lot of tough work, but it’s worth having the connection…….</p>

<p>“Oh, Tanaka, let’s do something interesting.”</p>

<p>“Okay, okay, wait a minute.”</p>

<p>　Perhaps feeling left out, Dojima-san interrupted and produced his business card.</p>

<p>　It was written in a master’s handwriting on a gold-colored piece of paper: “Ryuichiro Dojima” Even his business card has a strong habit.</p>

<p>“Now, I have to clean up the training camp, so that’s enough for today. Ayakawa, take Tanaka home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>　Rin replied to Mr. Dojima’s order.</p>

<p>　The next thing you know, it’s already time to go. I’ve met a lot of people and the time has gone by so fast.</p>

<p>“I’ll be in touch about the job. There’s a good sushi place nearby, let’s go out sometime”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’ll look forward to it.”</p>

<p>　I bowed to Dojima-san one last time and went to Rin.</p>

<p>“Can you take care of it for me then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s go, Sensei.”</p>

<p>　I left Dojima-sam with Rin.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>“……Well, we can clean up now.”</p>

<p>　After watching Tanaka leave, Dojima muttered to himself.</p>

<p>　The inside of the training ground was a mess, and there were many damaged parts.</p>

<p>“Isumi, can you take care of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Got it.”</p>

<p>　Yuki Izumi, Dojima’s secretary, then held up her hand toward the wall, which had a large gouge in it.</p>

<p>　Then, something like particles of light began to gather in her hand.</p>

<p>“Restoration light,”</p>

<p>　When Izumi said this, particles of light were released from her hand and sucked into the broken wall.</p>

<p>　In no time at all, the broken wall was repaired and returned to its original state. The people who had been training in the training hall saw this and went “Wow”</p>

<p>“As expected of Isumi. It’s a brilliant magic.</p>

<p>“Thank you”</p>

<p>　Isumi bowed her head in humility.</p>

<p>　The “magic” she just used can only be used by a limited number of awakened people.</p>

<p>　Among them, those who can use the attribute of “light,” which has the power to heal, are even more limited. If she had become an explorer, every guild would have wanted her.</p>

<p>“Then, can you do the floor too?　Sorry, I always ask you to clean up after me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m here for that. Rather than that, wouldn’t it be better to heal the …… minister first?”</p>

<p>　Isumi said while narrowing her eyes.</p>

<p>　Then, Dojima said mischievously, “Oh, you noticed?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Please let me see it quickly”.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, I’m no match for you, Isumi. ……”</p>

<p>　Dojima, while saying this, turns up his clothes and exposes his left flank.</p>

<p>　A while ago, Tanaka struck with the practice sword as hard as he could, and the spot was swollen bright red.</p>

<p>“Ah. He hit an old man with all his strength.”</p>

<p>“The minister encouraged him, didn’t you ? You got what you deserved.”</p>

<p>Isumi checked Dojima’s injuries while saying, “Several bones are broken, but it seems that his internal organs are fine.”</p>

<p>“It is a great feat to pierce through my steel abdominal muscles. If I hadn’t tightened my flesh, my internal organs would have ruptured.”</p>

<p>　Dojima laughed.</p>

<p>　His face was happy.</p>

<p>“You look very happy, Minister.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing more gratifying than the growth of young people. But I’m disappointed that people think I won, so please don’t mention this injury, okay?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, yeah. I got it.</p>

<p>　Isumi answered with a gentle smile and began to heal Dojima’s injuries with magic.</p>

<p>　As Dojima received treatment, he thought back to his match with Tanaka.</p>

<p>“Will you surpass your master, Tanaka? Maybe you can break through the dungeon that …… caused so much trouble for you.”</p>

<p>　Dojima muttered to himself as he thought about the yet-to-be-cleared Imperial Palace dungeon.</p>
