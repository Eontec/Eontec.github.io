<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　Rin takes me on a walk through the Ministry of Monster Control.</p>

<p>　It’s been a while since I’ve been here, but not much has changed inside.</p>

<p>　The budget is in order, and the place is well-cleaned. There are irresponsible people who ask for a budget cut in years when the number of monsters has decreased, but it seems that the minister is doing everything in his power to get rid of them.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　There is one thing that has changed since I was here in the past.</p>

<p>　It is ……</p>

<p>“……I feel like I’m being looked at a lot.”</p>

<p>　Every staff member I pass is glancing at me.</p>

<p>　And they are talking secretly with other staff members about something. Are they talking behind my back or something? ……</p>

<p>　I was worried about that, and Rin sensed it and spoke to me.</p>

<p>“The staff knows that the Sensei will be here today. I’m sure everyone is interested in it.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve been showing off too much.　I hope Dojima-san doesn’t come to a place like this.”</p>

<p>“……I think you’re mistaken, but the staff doesn’t want to smoke you out. In fact, it’s the opposite.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>　Just as I was about to ask her what the hell was going on, a female staff member came up to me.</p>

<p>　I was prepared to think that she was here to complain about something, but to my surprise, she offered me a piece of paper with her signature on it.</p>

<p>“Ah, um!　May I have your autograph, if you don’t mind?”</p>

<p>“Uh, Okay.”</p>

<p>　I took the paper and pen and handed it to her with my name written on it.</p>

<p>　Then the woman bowed and left me. and leaves me.</p>

<p>　She joined her colleagues a short distance away and happily said, “I got it!　I got it!” She was so happy. The other staff members were talking about how nice it was and how they would like to ask for it too.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think there were any fans of mine in the Ministry of Monster Control.”</p>

<p>“Of course there are. The staff members here have a deeper knowledge of dungeons than the average person, and they can understand the greatness of Sensei more deeply than the average person.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. ……”</p>

<p>　Rin explained it to me, but it still doesn’t feel right.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure if I’ll ever get used to this.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, are you getting along well with Amatsuki?”</p>

<p>　I ask Rin as we walk.</p>

<p>　Amatsuki is the head of the Subjugation Division. She is Rin’s boss.</p>

<p>“Yes. My sister …… Amatsuki has been very good to me. I woke her up this morning as well.”</p>

<p>“I see. You’re still living together, right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am a disaster orphan, so the only person I can rely on is Chief Amatsuki.”</p>

<p>　A disaster in which demons are taken out of a dungeon is called a “demon disaster”. It is called Masai for short.</p>

<p>　Rin lost her family to a demon disaster at a young age and was taken in by an institution. After that, Rin found out that she was an awakened person and knocked on the door of the Subjugation Division at a young age to avenge her family’s death, and she succeeded in getting in.</p>

<p>　From that time on, Amatsuki took the lead in taking care of Rin.</p>

<p>　They were so close that they looked like real sisters.</p>

<p>“That means I have younger sisterly qualities as well. That’s a great bonus.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, ……?” (Tl: Probably marketing herself)</p>

<p>　She still says the most absurd things with a clear face.</p>

<p>　That’s what makes him so interesting.</p>

<p>“By the way, my sister has been acting strange since this morning. Do you know anything about it?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea…..”</p>

<p>　I denied it, remembering what happened last night.</p>

<p>　Oh shit, my face is getting hot.</p>

<p>” <em>stare</em> “</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get going!　We don’t want to keep the minister waiting!”</p>

<p>“…… understood. Minister Dojima is in the courtyard right now. This way, please.”</p>

<p>　Accompanied by Rin, who looked at me questioningly, I stepped into the courtyard of the Ministry of Magic.</p>

<p>　There was a magnificent pine tree standing tall. They didn’t have anything like this when I was here. Where did they get it from?</p>

<p>　But this pine tree was bent over like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">bonsai tree</a>. …… I approached the tree and saw that it was in a huge flowerpot.</p>

<p>　Is this really a bonsai?</p>

<p>　As I was puzzled, someone who was tending the pine tree with a big pair of scissors noticed me and approached me.</p>

<p>“You came, Tanaka!　I’ve been waiting for you!”</p>

<p>　A large old man came up to me with a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>　He had short gray hair and sharp eyes. He must have been close to 60 years old, but his body was as big and thick as a football player’s.</p>

<p>　This man was Ryuichiro Dojima, Minister of the Ministry of Monster Control.</p>

<p>　He is the man in charge of dungeon-related matters in Japan.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time, Minister Dojima. I am glad to see you are in good health.”</p>

<p>“What’s with the way you’re talking? Why don’t you talk to me more frankly like you used to do? You’re not even in the workforce anymore, are you?”</p>

<p>“……You’ve just been made a minister, so I’m being polite. Is this okay?”</p>

<p>“Oooh!　You can do it!　I’m glad to see you’re still as cocky as ever”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Dojima-san slapped me on the back. The force of the slap was so great that I felt like I would be blown away if I didn’t hold on to my feet. In fact, the ground cracked under my feet every time he slapped me.</p>

<p>　He is a very lively person.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: Sorry for the late upload, I Just moved back in on campus. Dropped my stuff in my room and left to a friend’s place forgetting my laptop… Oh well, two chapters today, guess I’ve ended up testing the 2 chapters 2 days format unintentionally, poll is still on till the end of the week</p>

<p>Changes: Countermeasures –&gt; Control (It just sounds better as the name of a government body)</p>
