<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“This is the training camp. It’s a nice place.”</p>

<p>“It’s very …… spacious.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san took me to a huge gymnasium-like facility built behind the Ministry of Monster Control.</p>

<p>　　Everyone is in high spirits. They are all good warriors because Mr. Dojima is taking the initiative.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your hard work, Dojima-san!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　The people in the training area saluted when they saw Mr. Dojima.</p>

<p>　He is a funny old man in front of me, but he is a former member of the Self-Defense Forces and is spartan to his own people. He is strict about hierarchical relationships, but thanks to his charisma, he seems to be well-liked by the people here.</p>

<p>“Hey, look.”</p>

<p>“That’s …….”</p>

<p>　But the way they look at me is suspicious.</p>

<p>　Hmmm, I guess they don’t trust me. Well, when a dull guy like him suddenly becomes famous, it’s no wonder people look at him with suspicion.</p>

<p>　D-tubers are also often looked at with a white eye.</p>

<p>“They can’t forgive you either, can they?”</p>

<p>“Hey, Rin, calm down!　Don’t draw your sword!”</p>

<p>　　I hurriedly held back Rin, who was about to attack them.</p>

<p>　Even if you are a member of the government, you can’t afford to get yourself into trouble.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re mad at me for my sake, but you don’t have to do anything”</p>

<p>　I said as I looked at Kimura, whose eyes were filled with hostility.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know if I can handle it or not.”</p>

<p>“Sensei ……”</p>

<p>　Rin turns a strangely enthusiastic gaze towards me.</p>

<p>　Maybe I was a little too cool?　I hope she doesn’t think I’m lame.</p>

<p>　I’ve gotten into the habit of saying cool words to keep my sanity when I’m alone in the dungeon..</p>

<p>　So this is all Suda’s fault.</p>

<p>“Isumi-chan, are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m ready.”</p>

<p>　I noticed that Isumi-san was starting to roll the camera under the direction of Dojima-san.</p>

<p>　How long had he been preparing?</p>

<p>“Dojima-san, what’s that?”</p>

<p>“A popular person came to our place. There’s no way we won’t use it for publicity. I was thinking of streaming this match on the Internet. It’s a good idea since we have an official account with the Ministry of Monster Control.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you want to do that?”</p>

<p>“Hmm. I’m sure the other ministers will give me a hard time about it, but …… it’s fine!　If the need arises, I can just poke them in the head and make their memories fly away!”</p>

<p>　Mr. Dojima laughs, “Ha-ha-ha.”</p>

<p>　I’m sure he’s joking, but I’m afraid he might do it.</p>

<p>　Still, I wonder what Mr. Dojima is planning to do.　If SP loses this, the government’s reputation will be damaged.</p>

<p>　I don’t know what Mr. Dojima is thinking, but …… well, he won’t make it look bad. I’ll take his word for it.</p>

<p>“Kimura, you good too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m good. No problem.”</p>

<p>“Okay, let’s start streaming!”</p>

<p>　Mr. Dojima operates his phone and the stream begins.</p>

<p>　I also operate my phone to bring up the comment section of the stream in three dimensions.</p>

<p>「It’s rare to see the Ministry of Monster Control streaming live.」</p>

<p>「Is there an incident?」</p>

<p>「Is it a press conference?」</p>

<p>「The summary section says something about a mock match, but what is it?」</p>

<p>「What’s going on? - Is that Shachiken in the video?」</p>

<p>「No, it can’t be… it’s not… it’s ……」</p>

<p>「No way!　We have to spread the word!」</p>

<p>　The number of viewers grew as time went by.</p>

<p>　It seems to be spreading through social networking sites as well. I wonder if it is really safe.</p>

<p>「What kind of stream is this?」</p>

<p>「I mean, Minister Dojima is here!」</p>

<p>「Oh my God, there’s the devil Dojima here!」</p>

<p>「He’s as muscular as ever. That’s not a minister’s body!」</p>

<p>「Minister Dojima looked so cool at the Parliament the other day!」</p>

<p>「There’s his secretary, Isumi-san, too!　Big sister!」</p>

<p>“Wow, that’s Tanaka. The number of viewers is growing rapidly. This is getting fun.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san, in a good mood, explains the game to the viewers.</p>

<p>　I’ve been trying to keep the Yoyogi World Tree Dungeon under wraps and pretend that it was a test so that I can do my job for the government.</p>

<p>　Well, that’s certainly not the wrong way to put it.</p>

<p>「It looks like a lot of fun!」</p>

<p>「Is this the first time you’ve streamed Shachiken fighting people?」</p>

<p>「Only when he punched Suda.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Go for it!」</p>

<p>「The guy you’re fighting looks pretty strong.」</p>

<p>「He sure looks scary!」</p>

<p>　The viewers were excited.</p>

<p>　Dojima-san, looking satisfied with this, holds something in his hand and looks at me.</p>

<p>“Here, Tanaka, use this as your weapon. It’s sturdy, so you can swing it a little harder.”</p>

<p>　I catch the sword that Dojima-san throws to me.</p>

<p>　It is a practice sword with a blunt edge. It is made of materials from the dungeon.</p>

<p>“If I think of it as a way to get a new job, I guess it’s business. I’m not too excited about it, but I’ll give …… a try.”</p>

<p>　I swung my sword a few times to set the tone.</p>

<p>　Then Kimura opened his mouth as he watched.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave this job. This is our job.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know SPs these days do dungeon research, though I don’t know much about it. I am impressed by their diligence.”</p>

<p>　Kimura’s face clearly shows his miffed attitude as he says this.</p>

<p>　He doesn’t seem to have a tolerance for agitation.</p>

<p>“The N-SPs belong to the “Special Security Division” that was newly established after the Great Devil’s Disaster at the Imperial Palace. With us, there is no room for D-tubers.”</p>

<p>　Apparently, Kimura takes great pride in his N-SP status.</p>

<p>　I think the “N” in N-SP comes from NEXT, right? In English-speaking countries, we call an awakened person “Next,”.</p>

<p>　In other words, N-SP is a police organization composed only of awakened people.</p>

<p>“…… So they are the elite of the Metropolitan Police Department. You mean you can’t give a job to a freelancer with a junior high school diploma?”</p>

<p>“You can take it that way.”</p>

<p>　Kimura gripped his sword tightly.</p>

<p>　　He has an impressive stance, as he says.</p>

<p>「Sparks are flying between them」</p>

<p>「I hear N-SP is full of martial artists.」</p>

<p>「There’s no way our Tanaka will lose, right?　No way, right?」</p>

<p>「But we only see D-tubers fighting, so we don’t know much about the strength of other awakened people.」</p>

<p>「Finally, Tanaka’s plating is coming off.」</p>

<p>「Hey there, anti-tanaka!」</p>

<p>「I didn’t know there were still anti-tanaka. I thought they were extinct.」</p>

<p>「You’re such a believer! You still believe in that old man?」</p>

<p>　The comments are getting more and more excited.</p>

<p>　Well, let’s focus on what’s in front of us now. You can check what was said later. I’ve never reviewed the archives I’m in.</p>

<p>“If you take one hit and that’s it, there’s going to be a grudge. The match shall continue until either you surrender or I deem it impossible to continue. After, if a fighter goes down, let’s start over. I can’t stream an action like hitting a downed person. Is that okay?”</p>

<p>　We both replied “Yes” to Mr. Dojima’s words.</p>

<p>　I noticed that all the other people in the training ground were also watching our match. I don’t like to be the center of attention, but …… well, I’ll do my best.</p>

<p>「I wonder who’s going to win. I’m so excited.」</p>

<p>「Shachiken!　Don’t lose to such an unattractive guy!」</p>

<p>「Well, Tanaka’s on a roll, too, and I think it’s time he was punished, don’t you think?」</p>

<p>「What?　What do you mean, “ He’s on a roll”?　Go away, anti!」</p>

<p>「Go away, processed streamers!　You’re getting worse.」</p>

<p>「It’s getting rough.」</p>

<p>「It’s hard to use the internet if you can’t tell when something is doctored.」</p>

<p>「Well, we’ll see when the game starts. We’ll see if Shachiken is the real thing or not.」</p>

<p>　While the comments were getting lively, Dojima-san took his place as the referee and finally started signaling the start of the game.</p>

<p>“Then, both of you, fight fair and square. Get ready …… begin!”</p>

<p>　As soon as Mr. Dojima shouts this, Kimura rushes in with his sword held in front of him.</p>

<p>　Kimura tries to swing his sword straight at my head. His movement is similar to that of a kendo player striking with a mask. He probably learned kendo in the police academy.</p>

<p>　There is no waste in his movements. They are precise and efficient.</p>

<p>　He probably put a lot of effort into it. But ……</p>

<p>”—- too slow.”</p>

<p>　I sharply strike the back of Kimura’s right hand with my sword faster than he can release his attack.</p>

<p>　<em>Crack</em>　Along with the sound, I could feel the bone cracking in my hand. Unable to bear the pain, Kimura dropped his sword to the ground, his face contorted.</p>

<p>　Not missing the opportunity, I quickly swing the sword at his face.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the first strike.”</p>

<p>“Stop ……!”</p>

<p>　My sword slammed into Kimura’s face as if it was being sucked into his body.</p>

<p>　Kimura was hit hard in the face with a “mehkii” sound and was blown away by the impact, spinning several times in the air before falling to the ground.</p>

<p>「Oooooooooooooo!」</p>

<p>「I still can’t see you at all, lmao.」</p>

<p>「Huh?」</p>

<p>「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」</p>

<p>「Kimura-kun, is twirling around lol」</p>

<p>「Even an ordinary guy can beat the elite if he tries hard enough!」</p>

<p>「You’re a real fighter!」</p>

<p>「Mr. Certified Processor, you’re not saying anything.」</p>

<p>「How do you feel now, anti?　Hey, hey, hey, hey?」</p>

<p>“Gu, uh……”</p>

<p>　Kimura, who was blown away, stands up while holding the blood flowing from his nose.</p>

<p>　The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>　I pick up the sword he dropped and throw it back at him.</p>

<p>　Kimura takes it and faces me again. I told him I was going to go that far. He can’t take it back just because I hit him once.</p>

<p>“Come on. Let’s go until you’re satisfied.”</p>

<p>“……Yeah, sure.”</p>

<p>　kimura made a drastic change from the earlier statement and became serious as he replied.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: Today is the last day for the voting, well, till I translate the next chapter. I’ll post the results along with tommorows chaper, though there’s a chance I won’t be able to get a chapter out tommorow. I submitted the site to google to review for ads, But don’t worry, I’ll try to make the ads as minimal as possible, if you guys tap on them. I was planning on starting sponsored chapters and what not, but I still don’t have any ways to accept donations. I have a patreon though, but I’m not really up on how it all works. Oh well, Happy Weekend</p>
