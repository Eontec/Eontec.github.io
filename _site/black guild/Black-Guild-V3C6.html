<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>　Unlike before, Kimura confronts me with a sword in one hand and a cautious look on his face.</p>

<p>　The composure on his face is gone. It looks like he’s serious.</p>

<p>“Ha!”</p>

<p>　Kimura suddenly accelerates and starts running around me at high speed, shuffling and shuffling.
<!--more-->
　He seems to have decided that a head-on battle is not a good idea after that blow earlier. He probably intends to use his speed to distract me and take advantage of the opening.</p>

<p>「Kimura-kun is hopping around lmao」</p>

<p>「You’re doing a great job, Kimura.」</p>

<p>「As expected, you’re very strong.」</p>

<p>「Kimura!　How many kilos are you weighing now?」</p>

<p>「Wow, the Awakened are really something.」</p>

<p>　It’s true that he’s a lot faster than he was a moment ago.</p>

<p>　But the movement is monotonous. The rhythm is the key to disturbing the enemy. If you are just moving fast, it is easy to read your movements.</p>

<p>”—- here.”</p>

<p>　The moment the timing of Kimura’s footsteps changed, I moved my body to the right.</p>

<p>　Then Kimura’s sword swung down from behind me at the position I had been in. Kimura looked surprised as if he didn’t expect it to miss.</p>

<p>“The second one.”</p>

<p>　I evade the attack and immediately drive my sword into his torso.</p>

<p>　Even though it has no blade, the sword in my hand is still a blunt weapon. Kimura grunts in pain, “But ……! He grunts in pain and rolls on the ground.</p>

<p>「Wow, that looks really painful…….」</p>

<p>「Seriously, I don’t know what’s going on here.」</p>

<p>「Just when I thought Kimura appeared, he’s rolling on the ground lol」</p>

<p>「You’d have to turn it down to 0.25x speed to see it」</p>

<p>「You’re giving the middle finger to the double-speed culture.」</p>

<p>「Oh, Kimura, you’re standing up. You’ve got guts.」</p>

<p>「You should learn from the certified processor internet antis. Have they all run away already?」</p>

<p>“Ha, ha ……”</p>

<p>　Kimura stands up while looking pained.</p>

<p>　I can’t cut corners either, as long as he stands up. I’m not going to let you down.</p>

<p>“Let’s go, ……!”</p>

<p>　Kimura attacked again and again, changing his tactics.</p>

<p>　He leaps high and attacks from the air.</p>

<p>　He evades and counters with a thrust.</p>

<p>　Using weapons as bait, he attacks with his bare hands.</p>

<p>　Grabbing arms and throwing them to disable them.</p>

<p>　Continuous attack without catching his breath.</p>

<p>　A blow to the shoulder after all the attacks were dealt with.</p>

<p>　I dealt with all of Kimura’s attacks head-on and neutralized him.</p>

<p>　After repeating this back and forth, Kimura fell to his knees. It seemed that he had reached the limit of his physical strength.</p>

<p>“Gu, ugh. …….”</p>

<p>　Kimura tries to stand up with his sword propped up against the ground like a walking stick.</p>

<p>　However, the shoulder that was hit hurts and he can’t stand up properly. Kimura then looked at Dojima-san, who was refereeing, with a troubled look on his face.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking, “It looks like this is the end of it. ……,” Mr. Dojima suddenly shouts loudly,</p>

<p>“What are you looking so pathetic for, Kimura-san?　Wipe your own ass!”</p>

<p>　His voice is so loud that it shakes the training ground, and I involuntarily hold my ears.</p>

<p>　Oh, it’s still the same loud, stupid voice. ……</p>

<p>“Kimura. I’m not angry that you objected to my asking Tanaka to do the job. It’s not unusual for people to be unable to tolerate their work being taken by someone they don’t know.”</p>

<p>　After saying this, Mr. Dojima added, “But,” he said,</p>

<p>“It’s okay to question the strength of others.. Tanaka obtained his strength with the resolve to die for it. It is not something you can criticize with a half-hearted attitude. If you are going to question it, you need to be prepared to do so.”</p>

<p>　……This is when I realized why Mr. Dojima streamed.</p>

<p>　I was sure that he streamed it to shut up my antis. If I show my fight on the government’s account, they can’t doubt that it was doctored.</p>

<p>“But you are so pathetic that you immediately ask for help when you are at a slight disadvantage. …… I’d rather commit seppuku and die than expose myself to shame!　If you don’t like it, let me beat you to death!”</p>

<p>「So unreasonable lol」</p>

<p>「The worldview is like OtokoJuku.」 (Tl: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakigake!!_Otokojuku">manga/anime</a>)</p>

<p>「Heihachi Edajima of The 21st Century…」 (Tl: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sakigake!!_Otokojuku_characters#Staff">character</a>)</p>

<p>「Kimura-kun’s face is so pale.」</p>

<p>「Antis should get angry, too.」</p>

<p>「If he streams this, he’ll get slammed on the news again!」</p>

<p>「I can’t wait to see that apology press conference with no remorse. It’s so exciting.」</p>

<p>「I really like Minister Dojima.」</p>

<p>「Manliness personified.」</p>

<p>　He is as messed up as ever.</p>

<p>　But Kimura, perhaps thinking about those words, stands up and confronts me again.</p>

<p>“…… I apologize for my rudeness up to this point. I’d like you to take just one more fight.”</p>

<p>“……!　Yeah, absolutely.”</p>

<p>　Kimura grips his sword with both hands and holds it in front of him.</p>

<p>　I took the same stance and we faced each other.</p>

<p>　Then, after a moment of silence, Kimura yelled, “Haaaaah!” and raised his sword to the top and lunged at me.</p>

<p>　His movements were the same as before, but his attack was filled with a strong spirit.</p>

<p>　I struck the blow from the …… front.</p>

<p>“Ha!”</p>

<p>　Before Kimura’s sword could be brought down, my sword hit Kimura’s head with a thud!　</p>

<p>　Kimura, struck hard in the head, endured for a few seconds before crumpling to the ground with a thud.</p>

<p>…..</p>

<p>Tl Note: That’s it for the poll, apparently, you guys want one chapter a day. Also, I’m thinking of taking up another novel, but the releases of that will be pretty much radom, put your thoughts/recomendations in the comments. I’ll give updates later  if I decide to ofollow through, might even put it on patreon first.  <br />
Anyway</p>
