<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“That’s enough!　What a good fight!”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san confirms that Kimura has passed out and shouts loudly.</p>

<p>　Then Rin, who was watching the game, came toward me and offered me water and a towel.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your hard work, Sensei. Um, that was cool.”</p>

<p>“Really?　Thank you.”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　After wiping off my sweat and drinking the water, I replied, and Rin looked a little embarrassed and turned her head down.</p>

<p>　The viewers saw this and got excited.</p>

<p>「Hey, hey, who’s that beautiful girl?」</p>

<p>「Yui, he’s cheating on you!」</p>

<p>「She’s a cool beauty type …… the complete opposite of the cute type Yui!」</p>

<p>「When did he drop her?」</p>

<p>「I want a harem development!」</p>

<p>「I’ve seen that girl on TV before. I’m sure she’s the ace of the first subjugation division.」</p>

<p>「She’s cute and strong, she’s the best!」</p>

<p>「What?　Tanaka is strong and cute too!」</p>

<p>「You still have the same intense Tanaka fans…….」</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re misleading the viewers again. Sorry Rin.”</p>

<p>　Maybe people will go to town and say things like, “She’s Shachiken’s wife!” or something like that.</p>

<p>　I felt bad about that and apologized, but Rin’s reaction was surprising.</p>

<p>“…… No, I don’t mind at all, do you?”</p>

<p>“Eh?　Really?”</p>

<p>「Her face is totally a maiden in love!」</p>

<p>「This is already a confession, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「I saw a similar scene the other day.」</p>

<p>「I knew it! She’s his wife!」</p>

<p>「Oh, no, not this again!」</p>

<p>「I love couples who are in love with each other.」</p>

<p>「She’s totally in love with him, but he doesn’t even know it. I know a lot about this stuff.」</p>

<p>「Well, that can’t be right. ……, right?」</p>

<p>「He’s got his entire skill tree devoted to combat.」</p>

<p>“Well, Rin’s still so sweet that you don’t …… care!”</p>

<p>“…… no.”</p>

<p>「Look at him, he doesn’t even notice」</p>

<p>「I knew it.」</p>

<p>「Well, this is déjà vu!」</p>

<p>「Rin, you look so cute with your cheeks puffed out.」</p>

<p>「Damn, ……, I’m getting jealous!　I’m going to go get into a little dirty mood!」</p>

<p>「Go ahead and do it!」</p>

<p>「I’ll forgive Rin for being cute when she’s all pouty.」</p>

<p>　Ignoring the noisy comment section as usual, I look at the fallen Kimura.</p>

<p>　Just then, Dojima-san woke Kimura up and slapped him on the back to wake him up. He was as forceful as ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re awake.”</p>

<p>“Minister Dojima……?　 I see……”</p>

<p>　Kimura, who looked around and grasped the situation, managed to get up and walked slowly toward me.</p>

<p>　I could see the remorse on his face.</p>

<p>　I returned the water and towel I had been given to Rin and faced Kimura.</p>

<p>“…… again, I apologize for my rudeness. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>　As Kimura bowed his head, I said, “That’s okay. I’m not bothered by it,” and let him raise his face. I looked him in the eye and praised him for his good fight.</p>

<p>“If there are many people like you, the Metropolitan Police Department will be in good hands. It was a good match.” (Tl: Bro really said gg after wiping the floor with my guy lol)</p>

<p>“……!　Thank you, ……!</p>

<p>　Kimura and I shook hands firmly.</p>

<p>　The people who were watching the game applauded and cheered. Come to think of it, a lot of people were watching us. It’s kind of embarrassing.</p>

<p>「That was a good match!」</p>

<p>「I’ve got to give Kimura a second look!」</p>

<p>「Shachiken is the best!　Shachiken is the best!」</p>

<p>「I’m a little moved, to be honest.」</p>

<p>「It’s going to be made into a movie!」</p>

<p>「I’m impressed by the size of Shachiken’s character. If only he wasn’t so insensitive.」</p>

<p>　The comments were also very positive.</p>

<p>　Then Dojima-san comes to us.</p>

<p>“Gahahaha!　It rains and it pours, but the ground holds firm!　Good match!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dojima-san. Thanks to you, the misunderstanding on the Internet has been cleared up.”</p>

<p>“What is this about? All I did was to take advantage of you and punish him for getting carried away.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san blurted out in a deliberate manner.</p>

<p>　It seems that he doesn’t want me to owe him anything for this.</p>

<p>　He is probably trying to atone for not being able to help me out as a corporate slave. He’s a righteous man.</p>

<p>“But are you sure about that?　Wouldn’t it tarnish the government’s image if you lost the game?”</p>

<p>“That won’t be a problem. I will fight and show them my power.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a relief. ……, eeh?”</p>

<p>　I make a dumb sound after the sudden words of Mr. Dojima.</p>

<p>　What did this old man just say?</p>

<p>“I’ve been doing a lot of paperwork lately and I just wanted to get in some exercise. Of course you’ll come with me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san says, swinging the sword Kimura was using around.</p>

<p>　He’s been planning to do this from the beginning, hasn’t he?</p>

<p>“No, there is no reason for me to fight Dojima-san. Dojima-san has his own position, so don’t be so selfish.”</p>

<p>“What, are you afraid?　You are so pathetic. You are scared of an old man like me. I’m sure the old you would have ridden with me. You have become a corporate sword saint, and have become arrogant.” (Tl: Instigator Lv max)</p>

<p>“No problem!　You just do whatever you want, don’t you?”</p>

<p>「You took his bait lmao」</p>

<p>「Aren’t you too good at stirring things up, Minister?」</p>

<p>「He’s always stirring things up in the Congress.」</p>

<p>「Shachiken vs. Dojima, the devil, isn’t that too much to ask?　I wonder who’s going to win.」</p>

<p>「Dojima-san is a legend too, he destroyed a terrorist organization made up of …… awakened people by himself.」</p>

<p>「He’s one of the seven returnees. Wouldn’t even Shachiken be at a disadvantage?」</p>

<p>「Shachiken!　Show me your dream!」</p>

<p>　Dojima-san and I face each other, gripping our swords.</p>

<p>　In contrast to the excited comments, the inside of the training hall was quiet.</p>

<p>　Everyone here adores Dojima-san. Perhaps it was because they were able to watch the game of such an admired person, but their expressions were serious.</p>

<p>　I made sure not to miss his every move.</p>

<p>“One match is good, Tanaka. If you and I go at it until you fall, this building won’t last. If your weapon is broken, you lose. It’s too dangerous to do it with bare hands.” (Tl: Too dangerous for them or the environment?)</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand. No problem.”</p>

<p>　The bare hands of an awakened person with arms are more dangerous than a sword without a blade.</p>

<p>　 It is too dangerous to use indoors.</p>

<p>“I’m going to ask you to be the judge, Isumi. Now, Tanaka …… “Let’s do it until you’re satisfied,” right?　We can do the same.”</p>

<p>“…… You’re really good at stirring people up, aren’t you? All right then, please check out how strong I’ve become.”</p>

<p>　I grip my sword tightly and look at Mr. Dojima.</p>

<p>　 But now that I have overcome the hellish days of company slavery, I am sure that I am much stronger than I was then.</p>

<p>　I’ll show you the results of my efforts here.</p>

<p>“Then…… Start!”</p>

<p>　With Isumi’s shout, I started to run.</p>

<p>　The first move is always the winner. I don’t intend to prolong the game.</p>

<p>“Haaah!”</p>

<p>　I drew my sword and swung it down at Dojima-san’s face.</p>

<p>　The series of movements were, I thought to myself, lean and sophisticated. If it had been Kimura, he would not have been able to react.</p>

<p>　But it was that Dojima-san on the other end. He reacted to my attack with a grin, and with the sword in his hand, he caught my blow with a “Bash!”</p>

<p>　A shockwave scattered around the area, and a crack appeared at the foot of Dojima-san, who had caught it!</p>

<p>　Some of the spectators were blown away. However, Mr. Dojima, who was at the center of the impact, stood motionless. What kind of body structure does this guy have?</p>

<p>“Kuku. A heavy, good attack. It makes my blood boil.”</p>

<p>　He said happily. Has he really not been out in the field lately?</p>

<p>　I step away and readjust my stance.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself. Now let me …… get a little more serious. I’m full of respect for the elderly, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha-ha!　You little brat! I’ll play with you, so get your ass in here.”</p>

<p>　Mr. Dojima was smiling happily.</p>

<p>　I put strength into my legs and started to run toward him again.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Tl Note: What a development, Even I couldn’t predict it, but it doesn’t feel forced (Except for like the actual forcing aand instigation), 10/10. And Rin couldn’t possibly think she beats her boss/adopted elder sister in any way. I’ll sail the Amatsuki Ship till either I or she dies.</p>
