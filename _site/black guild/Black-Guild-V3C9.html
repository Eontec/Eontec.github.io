<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>”—- Tachibana-style swordsmanship, flash”</p>

<p>　I perform a technique as I pass the Gray Wolf, a monster that lives in the upper levels of the city.</p>

<p>　Two slashes were released. As I aimed, I slashed at its neck and abdomen, and succeeded in defeating the Gray Wolf. I was not satisfied with the …… result.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“…… this isn’t good enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh really?　I think you’re on the right track.”</p>

<p>　The one who came up to me saying that was my Master, Kisaki Tachibana.</p>

<p>　This person with a ponytail that extends to her waist is a famous person who is known as the strongest among explorers. She looks like a normal, good-natured big sister, but …… I know her strength well.</p>

<p>“Tachibana’s “flash” has slashed more than ten strikes. But mine has only two. ……It’s not even close.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure if Makoto’s sword is suited for the Tachibana style. Your sword is a ‘hard’ sword. You will be able to do it if you do flexibility exercises for about ten years.”</p>

<p>　Saying so, Tachibana-san lifted her right leg straight up and showed her I-balance.</p>

<p>　I’m impressed by her body, which is as soft as a mollusk’s,……, but this position is quite extreme in many ways, isn’t it?　I’m still in high school and this is not good for my mental health.</p>

<p>“Master, I can see a lot of things …….”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re so cute and sexy.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t tease me!”</p>

<p>　When I said that, Tachibana-san laughed amusedly and said, “Okay, okay, okay”. I’ve been getting teased by her ever since I joined her as an apprentice.</p>

<p>“What on earth should I do ……?”</p>

<p>“There is no need to panic, Makoto. It is true that it may be difficult to use the Tachibana style now. If that is the case, you can arrange the Tachibana way in your own way.”</p>

<p>“Arrangement, is it?</p>

<p>　I tilted my head and Tachibana nodded her head.</p>

<p>“I have already taught you the basics of Tachibana style. The next step is to modify it into a “ hard sword” style. You have a good enough muscle that I approve of it. You will be able to do it soon.</p>

<p>“Modifying the Tachibana style? …… but if you do that, what style will it be?”</p>

<p>　If you change Tachibana-ryu, which is a sword of softness, into a sword of hardness, it is already a different style.</p>

<p>　When I asked about this, Tachibana-san thought for a moment and opened her mouth.</p>

<p>“Ummm, …… ‘Tanaka-ryu’ or something like that?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s lame.”</p>

<p>　Sorry to all the Tanaka brothers and sisters in Japan, but I didn’t want to call myself that.</p>

<p>　The name Tachibana-ryu is so cool that the difference between the two is huge.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of orders, aren’t there? But if the family name is no good, then, say, ……Ga-ryu Kenjutsu?”</p>

<p>“That might be a good idea. I don’t know if I can call it my own style when it’s based on another style. ……”</p>

<p>“Haha, my old master might be upset, but I don’t mind. I am happy that my sword will continue even if the name is changed. You see, I can’t produce an heir.”</p>

<p>　Tachibana-san says with a little sadness in the depths of his eyes.</p>

<p>　Tachibana-san had a tremendous talent with the sword, but her body was incapable of producing children. Her family did not blame her for this, but as the only daughter of a family that has passed down swordsmanship from generation to generation, Tachibana was suffering from a sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>　Perhaps it was this guilt that made her see the talent in me, still a child, and teach me the art.</p>

<p>“…… Tachibana-san. It is true that I cannot use the Tachibana style yet. But I will definitely learn to use it and pass it on to the next generation. So please don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“Makoto…… heh, you really are a good kid”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Tachibana-san pet my head</p>

<p>　I felt a mixture of embarrassment and happiness. I shook her hand away. saying, “Please don’t treat me like a child” .What I wouldn’t say though is that I really wanted her to stroke my head a little more.</p>

<p>“If you say so Makoto,……, you’ll be saved. But don’t feel burdened. You can go ahead with your own path of the sword.”</p>

<p>　Tachibana-san beamed as she said that.</p>

<p>　A short time after this exchange,……, Tachibana-san died in the dungeon just below the Imperial Palace.</p>

<p>　The seven years that have passed since that incident, there are fewer people who remember Tacibana-san, but I will never forget her or the swordsmanship she taught me.</p>

<p>　As long as this sword is inherited, I can proudly say that Tacibana-san is still alive.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>“…… this technique reminds me of her”</p>

<p>　I muttered to myself as I savored the feel of the technique on my hands.</p>

<p>　The next moment, Isumi’s clear voice echoed through the training area.</p>

<p>　I felt a little nervous at times, but it seemed that we had managed to win.</p>

<p>　When I looked up, the people who were watching the game applauded and cheered in unison. I remembered that they were watching me. I was so focused that I had forgotten.</p>

<p>「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the strongest!」</p>

<p>「Hey, I don’t even know what happened it was over before I knew what was going on.」</p>

<p>「What happened at the end?　Didn’t Shachiken’s sword disappear?」</p>

<p>「I saw it too.」</p>

<p>「I rewinded and slowed it down, but I don’t get it.」</p>

<p>《kanade》 「He’s switching swords on his back. It’s so smooth that it looks like the sword is disappearing. But still, you beat Dojima-san. …… That’s amazing. I’m in love with you again.」</p>

<p>「You’re so confident with your sword, aren’t you?」</p>

<p>「That sounds like a good explanation.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure she’s Kanade Amatsuki of the First Subjugation Division, since her account name is “kanade” and she knows Tanaka.」</p>

<p>「A detective appears.」</p>

<p>「Oh, really?」</p>

<p>「I remember she was on the stream that Suda was on. I wonder if they know each other.」</p>

<p>「I heard a gossip article that they’ve been friends since childhood.」</p>

<p>《kanade》「I exercise my right to remain silent.」</p>

<p>「This looks like a real deal.」</p>

<p>　The comments are getting more and more excited.</p>

<p>　It looks like they enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“Nice last hit, Tanaka.”</p>

<p>“Dojima-san.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san looks back at me. His face is radiant.</p>

<p>　He is an extremely competitive person, but this time he seemed to be willing to give up the win. That’s what I thought. ……</p>

<p>“Well, that’s really impressive!　I never thought you would draw with me!”</p>

<p>“…… what?”</p>

<p>　I asked back at the unexpected words.</p>

<p>　No matter how you look at it, it was my victory. Dojima-san’s sword didn’t touch me at all.</p>

<p>“Here, look at that.”</p>

<p>“that?”</p>

<p>　I followed his gaze and saw the sword I was holding.</p>

<p>　The blunt sword for matches was …… neatly broken in half. It should have been made quite sturdy, but this old man has hard muscles…!</p>

<p>“I told you before the match that if your weapon broke, you lost. I told you that before the match. Unfortunately, even that sword was no match for my steel abs!　Tanaka did well, too,…… but I’m afraid this match is a draw. Mm.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!　You know that my attack hit you before it broke!　Just because you don’t like losing doesn’t mean you just deny my win!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, shut up, shut up!　If I say it’s a draw, it’s a draw!”</p>

<p>「Minister Dojima is being so unreasonable!」</p>

<p>「You can be pissed off, Shachiken!」</p>

<p>「These two are so close.」</p>

<p>「It seems like they’ve known each other for a long time.」</p>

<p>「You’re like a grandson nursing his granddad.」</p>

<p>“haha …… we can call it a draw now.”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha-ha, we’ll just have to see.”</p>

<p>　We continued to argue for a while, but I gave up, losing my patience.</p>

<p>　He really doesn’t change, at all.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: So turns out I can no longer use Tanaka Sytle, cuz Even the person hates it, I’ll go back to the default. Amatsuki literaly confessed in the comment section. We got a backstory drop. A lot more than I expected happened this chapter</p>
