<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　It was a beautiful sunny Sunday.</p>

<p>　I was visiting the site of the former Sky Tree.</p>

<p>　The white radio tower that once represented Tokyo no longer exists in Tokyo.</p>

<p>　The Sky Tree disappeared as if sucked into the ground at the same time the dungeon was born.   <br />
<!--more-->
　Incidentally, the Sky Tree is not the only one that has disappeared.</p>

<p>　So the Sky Tree has given up its role to its predecessor, the Tokyo Tower. There is talk of building a new radio tower, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is hesitant to do so because there is a strong possibility that the big structure will disappear again.</p>

<p>　If it disappears again, a large amount of taxpayers’ money will be blown away. It is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>“But where did it disappear to?”</p>

<p>　As I stood there, remembering the white tower in my memory, I saw a figure running toward me.</p>

<p>“Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting, Sensei.”</p>

<p>　The one who bowed with such a bow was my student, Rin.</p>

<p>　She was not dressed in her usual uniform, but in a cute plain outfit. I had never seen her in private before, so it was very fresh. To be honest, I was a little nervous.</p>

<p>“I just got here too, so don’t worry about it. I’m more interested in your clothes. You look good in them.”</p>

<p>“Really?　I don’t have a lot of clothes that I can show you, so I was a little nervous about it,……, but I’m glad.”</p>

<p>　Rin smiled happily.</p>

<p>　Even though she is like that, her gaze moved to the side and found someone a little behind me, and her gaze became a little sharper.</p>

<p>“I’d like to introduce you to a colleague of mine, Hoshino Yui.”</p>

<p>“Yo, nice to meet you. …….”</p>

<p>　Hoshino steps forward with an apologetic look on her face.</p>

<p>By the way, I had sent a message to Hoshino in advance that Rin was coming. It was unusual for Hoshino to take so long to reply.</p>

<p>“I know her well from ……. She was on your stream.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, that’s a quick story. I let the two of you meet because you’re both the same age and awakened, and I thought you two would get along well. Look, isn’t it better than being alone with someone like me?”</p>

<p>　When I said that, Hoshino and Rin sighed at exactly the same time “Haaaa”</p>

<p>　What is it? Did I possibly do something wrong?</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t expect that …… Sensei would come that way. It’s going to be a tough road ahead, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Haha. I was surprised too. I’m sure you are too, aren’t you, Ayakawa-san……?　It’s tough on both of us, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true for you too, Hoshino-san? That means we’re love rivals, right?”</p>

<p>“Hmmm, that’s true.</p>

<p>　Hoshino laughs happily.</p>

<p>“It’s true that we are love rivals, but I’d be happy if we could become good friends.”</p>

<p>“I understand. We are love rivals and also friends. It would be good to get to know each other better. Nice meeting you, Hoshino-san.”</p>

<p>“Yup♪”</p>

<p>　The two talked happily and then shook hands.</p>

<p>　I have no idea what they are talking about. Is it a current fad among girls?</p>

<p>“Sensei. What are your plans for today?”</p>

<p>“Ah I’m going to the arms shop today. I want to take care of my sword and strengthen Hoshino’s sword.”</p>

<p>　The materials from the “mount dragon” that was killed the other day are still in my bag.</p>

<p>　I’m planning to use it to strengthen my weapon today.</p>

<p>“Well, it’d be boring if we only did that, so let’s get something to eat. I’ll pay for it, of course.”</p>

<p>“Really?　Thank you!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino bites into it with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>　If she’s happy, it’s worth making my thin wallet even thinner.</p>

<p>　Since the money earned from the stream has not yet been deposited, the money to be used today will come from my meager savings from my days as a company employee. I wish I had taken some money from Adachi.</p>

<p>“Um, There is a famous cafe near here, and I want to have a parfait there. Is that okay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course. It would be great if you could tell me about such a place. Is it okay for Rin to go with us? Tell me if you don’t like sweets”</p>

<p>“Well, I like sweets too. ……”</p>

<p>“Okay, Then it’s decided, let’s go there.”</p>

<p>　After deciding where to go, we started walking while having small talk</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tl Note: Unexpected meeting of two harem members, and they seem to not have a bad dynamic. Still on with Amatsuki supremacy though, them man-stealers need to know their place, plus she’s definitely the strongest of the three, and most influential.</p>
