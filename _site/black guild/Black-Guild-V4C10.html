<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　After safely defeating the suspicious people, I took a breath and said, “Phew.”  <br />
　I looked around for any sign of them, but there didn’t seem to be anyone else hiding. I guess I could consider it safe for the time being.</p>

<p>As I was wondering what I should do now, Rin, who had sent the hostage girl to safety, came back to me.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>“Sensei!”<br />
“Whoa!”</p>

<p>　Rin jumped into my chest with all her might.     <br />
　It was so fast that I was about to be blown away, but I caught it with my legs. If I were a normal person, my sternum would be shattered.</p>

<p>“Sensei……Thank you……!”</p>

<p>　Rin was trembling as she buried her face in my chest.<br />
　They took a hostage and had a gun pointed at her. The fear was immense. The emotions that had been suppressed were now overflowing.</p>

<p>“I’m proud of you, You are indeed my proud student.”</p>

<p>　I continued to stroke her head until she calmed down.<br />
　I felt really embarrassed because this was also being streamed, but right now it was more important to be there for Rin.</p>

<p>「It’s so hot, isn’t it?」<br />
「You’re doing it again.」<br />
「Tanaka!　Take responsibility!」<br />
「I really envy you. I wish I could switch places with you.」<br />
「It’s true. I wish I could be hugged by Shachiken too!」<br />
「 Yeah, yeah!」<br />
「Over there!」<br />
「The audience is seriously turning into meth heads.」<br />
「I can’t tell if you’re serious or not.」<br />
「Maybe 40% of them are serious.」</p>

<p>　As I ignored the comments that were saying whatever they wanted, about five people appeared who were rushing toward me.<br />
　That outfit looks a lot like the one Rin is wearing. So are they from the Subjugation Division?</p>

<p>　Rin noticed them approaching and quickly backs away from me, trying to look nonchalant.<br />
　She was indeed embarrassed to be seen hugging me by her co-workers. Well, it was streamed all over the country. …… I’ll keep quiet about that.</p>

<p>　The man who seemed to be the leader among the five came out in front of me.<br />
　He was a young man with a fearless face. He looked like someone I had seen before.</p>

<p>“It has been a while, Mr. Tanaka. I am Tsukasa Todo of the Subjugation Division. I had you train me before.”<br />
“Oh, …… is that right? It’s been a long time, Todo-san.”</p>

<p>　I shook hands with the man who introduced himself as Todo.<br />
　I don’t remember each and every one of them since there were so many members that trained under me. I remember Rin because she got into trouble a lot and was very talented.</p>

<p>　As I recall, this Todo guy was not as strong as Rin, but he was strong. It seems he has grown up and is now working in the Subjugation Division.</p>

<p>“Thanks to your streaming, I understand the situation on the ground. I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving Ayagawa and the hostage girl. We will be sure to thank you for this later.”<br />
“I’m glad to hear that, but …… I think it’s better to think about dealing with that  now.”</p>

<p>　I said this and turned my attention to the entrance to the dungeon that appeared at the site of the former Skytree.<br />
　I’m sure there wasn’t anything like that when I came here this morning. Did the appearance of that thing bring those suspicious people here?　I’m thinking, They acted too fast for that, but then Rin overheard me and Todo-san.</p>

<p>“Actually…….”</p>

<p>　According to Rin’s story, that dungeon was created by those suspicious guys earlier. I’ve never heard of people making dungeons.<br />
　It is not an easy story to believe, but there is no way Rin would lie about it. It must be true.</p>

<p>　We decided to keep the fact that this is a man-made dungeon out of the conversation for now. If this fact were to spread through streaming, it would cause panic among many people.<br />
　It will eventually become known, but it doesn’t have to be now.</p>

<p>“When a new dungeon is discovered, the Labyrinth Management Bureau will be on hand to preserve and investigate. First, the entrance will be sealed, then …….”</p>

<p>　As he was explaining this, Todo-san’s expression suddenly hardened.<br />
　His eyes were filled with confusion and surprise. I wondered what was going on, and I looked at the entrance to the dungeon beyond his gaze.</p>

<p>　Then I learned the reason for his surprise.</p>

<p>“…… Really?”</p>

<p>　A small slime came out of the dungeon, bouncing around.<br />
　It was an ordinary slime with no special abilities. It was rank E, the weakest of all the monsters.</p>

<p>　But that’s not the problem.<br />
　The problem is that the monster came out of the dungeon. This is out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>「Did that slime come out of the dungeon?」<br />
「No, that can’t be true ……, seriously?」<br />
「Yeah, why!　You’re lying!」<br />
「Are you kidding me?　I live in the next block!」<br />
「No. It’s scary!」<br />
「It’s a monster disaster!　I have to get out of Tokyo!」<br />
「This sucks!」</p>

<p>　The comments quickly turned into a snarl.<br />
　I swung my sword at high speed, sending a shockwave and knocking down the slime, but the chaos didn’t stop anymore. That’s how crazy it is to have monsters out there.</p>

<p>“A 『Unique Dungeon』 of all things. ……”</p>

<p>　I swear, things are so bad.<br />
　Right now, only weak monsters were showing up, but if we let things continue as they are, stronger and stronger monsters will be coming out of the dungeons.<br />
　I can’t believe such a dungeon would appear in the heart of the city. Even if I don’t like it, I remember the time when the Imperial Palace dungeon was born.</p>

<p>“No. ……”</p>

<p>　It was Rin who let out a small voice.<br />
　Her pretty face turned blue, and her eyes were filled with deep despair and fear.</p>

<p>　Rin lost her parents in a monster disaster when she was a small child. She must be remembering that time.</p>

<p>　…… I can’t just leave this dungeon like this, can I?</p>

<p>“Todo-san. Can I destroy this dungeon?”<br />
“Eh, Eeehhhh!?　It is true that this dungeon is dangerous, but …… I have no right to give you that permission. I am sorry …….”</p>

<p>　Todo-san apologetically lowered his eyes.<br />
　Dungeons are valuable resources. Destroying it without permission is strictly prohibited by law. No matter what the reason, breaking it would make me a criminal.</p>

<p>　However, I could not sit idly by and watch Rin in this state.<br />
　I could go under the radar, prepared to get caught, but that would make Rin feel responsible.</p>

<p>　I was wondering what I should do.<br />
　I looked around and thought about what might be useful, and then I saw a drone streaming on and came up with an idea.</p>

<p>“If it’s that guy, he’s on ……!”</p>

<p>　I operated my phone and brought the drone close to me.<br />
　Then I spoke into the camera.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dojima, I’m watching this feed, aren’t I? You are watching this stream, aren’t you?　If you’re watching, please comment.”</p>

<p>「Eh?」 <br />
「What’s up with you all of a sudden, Tanaka!」 <br />
「I’m preparing to run away, but I’m also curious about the stream.」 <br />
「Are you watching, Minister?」 <br />
「Yes, yes! Are you watching, Minister Dojima?」 <br />
「What’s going on?」 <br />
《Ministry of Monster Control Official》「Oh, you got it, huh? Oh, how did you know? I’m watching you perfectly.」 <br />
「Why is he the minister now?」 <br />
「What?」 <br />
「He’s really watching us.」 <br />
「What?」 <br />
「That was weird.」 <br />
「Don’t look at it on the official account.」 <br />
「I can’t believe I’m seeing a collaboration between Minister Dojima and Shachiken again.」</p>

<p>　I found the Ministry of Monster Control’s account among the comments flowing, and I smile. <br />
　I knew this person would definitely be watching me.</p>

<p>　He must have understood what I wanted him to do, and he must be working on it.</p>

<p>“I’m going to destroy this dungeon now. Please give me permission.”  <br />
“Who are you talking to? I’ll take all the responsibility, so just go.”</p>

<p>　Dojima-san responded quickly to my request, as if he had been prepared for it.</p>
