<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　After receiving permission from Dojima-san to destroy the dungeon, I took my eyes off the comment section.</p>

<p>　If a newly created dungeon is to be destroyed without any investigation, there will probably be many council members and groups who will oppose it. These are usually people who have never dived in a dungeon or fought monsters.</p>

<p>　If they knew firsthand the horror of dungeons, they would not oppose the destruction of singular dungeons. If we were to make even the slightest error in our response, it would be a repeat of the incident that occurred in the Imperial Palace dungeon. We must never let that happen again.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Dojima-san has his work cut out for him dealing with people like that. He took care of this case lightly, but it must be hard to silence those who are against it. I’ll bring him some yokan next time.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-sama, you are going into the dungeon, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>　Todo-san, the young man from the first division, asked me with a mysterious look on his face. Behind him were several of his subordinates.</p>

<p>“We will be happy to help you. We have been in dungeons many times ourselves.”</p>

<p>“No…… I will go alone this time. You are to monitor the dungeon and rescue the civilians.”</p>

<p>　The police and emergency services had already begun to arrive, but some buildings had collapsed, so it would take some time to rescue those who had failed to escape. The people of the First Division are all awakened, so if they can help, they will be a force of a hundred.</p>

<p>“However, it would be …… unwise to leave everything to an outsider, Tanaka-sama.”</p>

<p>　Todo-san was insisting.</p>

<p>　He is a government official who couldn’t back down either.</p>

<p>　But for me, it would be better if he didn’t follow me. I’m sure they’re good at what they do, but they don’t have as much experience in dungeons as I do.</p>

<p>　If it were an ordinary dungeon, they could follow me, but it is a unique dungeon that we are going to dive.</p>

<p>　In addition, this dungeon is freshly built, and I don’t know what the structure is like inside. My guess is that it’s under construction, and it’s expanding rapidly downwards. I don’t think people who aren’t used to it will be able to handle it.</p>

<p>　While I was wondering what to do, someone who had remained silent until then spoke up.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in with Sensei. That would be fine, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>　It was Rin who said that.</p>

<p>　Rin is also a member of the First Division, so if she joins me, it will at least save their face.</p>

<p>“Well, I can move without hesitation if Rin comes with me. It will be great help if you do”</p>

<p>　As soon as I said that, Rin’s face lit up.</p>

<p>　Todo-san, who saw the exchange, thought for a moment and then agreed to do so.</p>

<p>“The situation is urgent, and we will follow the decision of Tanaka-sama, the dungeon professional. I ask for your cooperation.”</p>

<p>　With that, Todo-san bowed his head deeply and headed off with his men to save lives.</p>

<p>　The two of us, Rin and I, looked at each other, nodded, and stood in front of the entrance to the dungeon.</p>

<p>「I’ve never seen anyone dive into a newly built dungeon before.」</p>

<p>「It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a new dungeon.」</p>

<p>「This is really valuable footage, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「My heart is pounding lol」</p>

<p>「Me too, Me too」</p>

<p>「I feel a great sense of unity. It’s hot and something I’ve never felt before.」</p>

<p>「I’m scared of unique dungeons, but …… I’m not going to run away. I’m sure Shachiken will do it.」</p>

<p>「The fact that there hasn’t been too much commotion is definitely something that only Shachiken can do.」</p>

<p>「I’m relieved too.」</p>

<p>「On the other hand, if Tanaka loses, everyone will be in despair.」</p>

<p>「Good luck, Tanaka!　You’re our hope!」</p>

<p>「My son is rooting for you, too.」</p>

<p>　The comments were all excited as I was about to enter a singular dungeon.</p>

<p>　There were quite a few voices cheering me on. I’m very touched when I see this kind of thing. I must do my best to live up to the expectations.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking this, Rin, standing next to me, chuckled.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m just happy to think that I’ll be able to dive in the dungeon with you again like this. I’m sorry, it’s inappropriate for me to think about this right now.”</p>

<p>　Rin said with a thin blush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>　　I felt after spending the whole day with her today that Rin’s feelings for me may be a little different from the feelings that arise between a student and a teacher or between a sister and an older brother, and that they may be one step further. (Tl: What the hell is happening?)</p>

<p>　I have come to realize this because I am gradually regaining a human heart after being released from the corporate workforce.</p>

<p>　I don’t have any proof yet, but if that’s how she feels, I have to face it properly. After this one is over, it might be a good idea to talk to someone about it.  (Tl: Code Red people, Tanaka has begun thinking)</p>

<p>“Now, it’s been a while since I’ve worked on my day off. Rin, can you go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m ready. I will do my best not to slow you down”</p>

<p>　Rin said so dependably. It’s reassuring to know that.</p>

<p>　Before entering the room, I looked down at the comments and found that the official account of the Ministry of Evil Countermeasures had made a teasing comment, “Hey, stop flirting with each other and get in there” (Tl: Imagine an Official Account saying that lol)</p>

<p>　I stepped into the dungeon, thinking that the next time I saw Dojima-san, I would complain to him.</p>

<p>…..</p>

<p>Tl Note: I madde a discord Server and added a Patreon Link. There’s nothing on the patreon right now, nut you can donate there. Tanaka Is not as Dense as we all thought. (I wish I could go tell that guy with thw two star review on NU).</p>
