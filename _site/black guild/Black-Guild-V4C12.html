<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　Dungeons always appear suddenly.</p>

<p>　There is no warning of their appearance, and they suddenly break the ground with a tremor and emerge from underground.</p>

<p>　The dungeons are immediately investigated and controlled by the government, and it is not until three months later that explorers are able to enter them.
<!--more--> <br />
　Therefore, it is usually impossible to enter a newly born dungeon, and of course I had never been in one myself.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been in a newborn dungeon. ……”</p>

<p>　My first impression was “distorted”.</p>

<p>　The interior of the dungeon was undulating and very uneven. Normal dungeons have a much more orderly appearance.</p>

<p>“It’s amazing. …… I’ve never seen anything like this before.”</p>

<p>“Hm?　Is it the first time for Rin too?”</p>

<p>　I thought that Rin, who works for the government, is used to seeing this kind of scene, but it seems that she is not.</p>

<p>“The dungeon is still changing inside, so it is forbidden to go inside. It is not until about a week after its birth that we begin to investigate. By that time, the dungeon is almost stable.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>　There was a large hole in front of me that went deep underground.</p>

<p>　The shape of the hole was constantly changing. Perhaps it was searching for the best shape. In this way, it gradually takes on the familiar shape of a dungeon.</p>

<p>　That’s fine, but the way the hole kept changing its shape was like a “living creature,” and it made me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>　Maybe the dungeon is a giant creature. I likened dungeons to insectivorous plants, and maybe I am right.</p>

<p>“I can’t leave the unique dungeon alone, even though it’s dangerous. We’ll take the shortest route.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll follow you.”</p>

<p>　Rin and I nodded to each other and threw ourselves into a large hole.</p>

<p>　Our bodies suddenly accelerated and we fell into the deepest part of the dungeon.</p>

<p>「Aaahhh!」</p>

<p>「We’re falling again, lol.」</p>

<p>「We’ve got our quota for the fall.」</p>

<p>「I didn’t prepare any dizzy today!」</p>

<p>「First time?　Its time to relax!」</p>

<p>「Rin, you don’t hesitate to fall, do you?」</p>

<p>「You’ve got to be able to do that to be Shachiken’s apprentice.」</p>

<p>「The hole is too deep, how far can you fall?」</p>

<p>　The hole in this dungeon was so deep that we kept falling for a while.</p>

<p>　If this dungeon had been completed, it would have been very difficult to conquer. We could go down all the way to the bottom like this because it was still under construction, but once it was finished, the hole would have been blocked and we would have had to go down little by little.</p>

<p>“…… Nn?”</p>

<p>　After falling for a while, I found something moving on the wall of the hole.</p>

<p>　It changed its shape and suddenly sent something flying toward us.</p>

<p>“Enemy attack!　Six o’clock!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>　Rin and I braced ourselves in the air and dodged the flying object.</p>

<p>“Then we kicked each other’s feet together and moved through the air. I held myself still with my hands on the wall. Rin also stopped with her blade against the wall.”</p>

<p>“Looks like they don’t want us to go deeper.”</p>

<p>　A number of slimes emerged from the small holes in the wall.</p>

<p>　These are the ones that attacked us earlier. Ordinary slimes can’t do that, so they must be the “high slimes,” a higher level of slime. They can detach themselves and attack from a distance.</p>

<p>「Ororo, that’s disgusting.」</p>

<p>「If it was just one, it would be cute, but when there are a lot of them coming out of the hole, it’s too creepy.」</p>

<p>「Yikes. I have a phobia of clusters.」</p>

<p>「But if they’re slimes, they’re easy to kill, aren’t they?」</p>

<p>「If you underestimate slime, you’ll die.　There are so many different kinds of slime, it’s easy to die if you’re not careful.」</p>

<p>「It’s hard to tell the different types from their appearance. Acid slime shoots acid that melts bones, so you can’t be too careful.」</p>

<p>「Dissolving bones is too scary …….」</p>

<p>　A wide variety of slimes came out and attacked us.</p>

<p>　I could ignore them and force my way through, but it would also be troublesome to be targeted from behind. I pulled out my sword and cut down the approaching slimes in order.</p>

<p>「Slime-kun and the others are getting cut through lol.」</p>

<p>「They aren’t even any good as enemies, are they?」</p>

<p>「Some slimes have poison, but Shachiken is resistant to it anyway.」</p>

<p>「They’re too bad as opponents. ……」</p>

<p>「Isn’t that what you use to refer to the monsters?」</p>

<p>「Well, the best monster on the screen is Tanaka. ……」</p>

<p>　After clearing away most of the slime that had rushed in, I suddenly hear a voice above me say, “Kyaaa!” from overhead.</p>

<p>　I looked up and to my surprise, Rin was caught by a giant translucent tentacle.</p>

<p>　The tentacles were growing out of multiple holes in the wall. They seem to be connected at the back.</p>

<p>“Tentacle slime. That’s quite a nuisance.”</p>

<p>　Tentacle slimes, as the name suggests, are slimes with tentacles. The tentacles are quite thick and numerous.</p>

<p>　No matter how many of its tentacles are cut, no damage can be inflicted, and it cannot be defeated without destroying the nucleus of the main body.</p>

<p>　The main body is always hidden in the ground or in a hole, and only the tentacles are visible outside, making it an extremely difficult monster to defeat.</p>

<p>　Its rank is A, which is quite high for a slime species, and it is recommended that you go around it when you encounter it.</p>

<p>“You, let go of me ……!”</p>

<p>　Rin resists, but the slimy tentacles seemed to prevent her from escaping.</p>

<p>　The tentacle slime was fortunately not very strong, so it didn’t seem to be painful. However, the more she trashed around, the more mucus it produced.</p>

<p>「Eggghh!」</p>

<p>「Too much.」</p>

<p>「REC.」</p>

<p>「Thank you, thank you very much.」</p>

<p>「The door to my sexuality has been pried open.」</p>

<p>「Oh, my poor baby…」</p>

<p>「You guys have got to be kidding me. ……」</p>

<p>「There’s nothing but perverted degenerates here.”</p>

<p>　The perverts were getting excited with their comments.</p>

<p>　It’s a pity to see her like that, and I feel bad too. I’ll try to help her as soon as I can.</p>
