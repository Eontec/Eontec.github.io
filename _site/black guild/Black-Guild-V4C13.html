<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　I ran up the wall and approached Rin.</p>

<p>　The surface of the tentacle slime is sticky unlike that of ordinary slimes. This mucus is not harmful, but it is a hindrance when slashing.</p>

<p>　If you use a sword with poor sharpness, it slips on the surface and you cannot cut it. My sword had just been sharpened by Miss Kaoru, so that won’t happen to me.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Rin, I’m coming!”</p>

<p>“Sensei ……!　No, don’t worry about me…….!”</p>

<p>　Rin, after seeing me, began to put all her strength into her body.</p>

<p>　Her body then began to be charged with electricity. She was converting the magic essence in her body into electricity.</p>

<p>“Emission …… lightning!”</p>

<p>　Fierce lightning gushed out from Rin’s entire body.</p>

<p>　The tentacles of the tentacle slime that had grabbed her were struck by it, and they writhed in agony. Slime species tend to be generally vulnerable to lightning attacks.</p>

<p>　That one must have hit it pretty hard.</p>

<p>『――――！！』</p>

<p>　The tentacle slime, with some of its tentacles burned off, retracted its tentacles into the hole. Then Rin, who was trapped, was thrown into the air.</p>

<p>I immediately kicked off the wall and caught the freed Rin in mid-air. I was a little embarrassed because I was holding her like a princess, but I held on.</p>

<p>“Nice attack.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, …… Sensei.”</p>

<p>　Rin looked a little tired, but she was fine without a scratch. So, I think we could continue the battle without any problems.</p>

<p>　If there was a problem …… it would be the sticky mucus on our clothes. I don’t think it’s going to be too much of a problem, but I’m having trouble finding a place to put my eyes.</p>

<p>“Sensei? Is something wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Nothing.”</p>

<p>　I turned my head away from Rin, who asked me at close range, looking into my face.</p>

<p>　It’s no good. If you have evil feelings toward your students, you’re not a qualified teacher.. I must think of Four Character idioms to calm my mind. Shintou doroku shiroto kozoku yakiniku teishoku: …… <a href="#fn-1" class="fnref" id="fnref-1">1</a></p>

<p>「It’s rare to see Shachiken being embarrassed.」</p>

<p>「If you push him, you’ll get it!」</p>

<p>「I can’t see Rin well because Tanaka is in the way!」</p>

<p>「I can’t see!」</p>

<p>「 can’t see!」</p>

<p>「Has Tanaka been covered in mucus yet?」</p>

<p>「Who’s benefit is that?」</p>

<p>「What?　I deserve it. （I want to see it.)」</p>

<p>「I want to see it too.」</p>

<p>「Me too.」</p>

<p>「I think so, too」</p>

<p>「I knew it, you’re all perverts!」</p>

<p>　After calming myself down, I first removed the mucus from my shoulders and cheeks with my bare hands.</p>

<p>　I shook my hand at high speed and used the wind pressure to remove the mucus from my hands. I was very careful not to hit Rin.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sensei. Um, I’m sorry, but may I ask you to …… help me as well?”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Rin brought her chest closer.</p>

<p>　They had grown bigger than they were when she was a child, and of course there was a lot of mucus.</p>

<p>「Rin-chan attacking aggressively lol.」</p>

<p>「She’s fallen, I’m sure of it.」</p>

<p>「She’s too clever.」</p>

<p>「She’s leading the heroine race!」(Tl: Tch, Tch, not true)</p>

<p>「Yui’s spiritual pressure is …… gone ……!」</p>

<p>「Aggressive Ayagawa.」</p>

<p>「She’s so good!」</p>

<p>「What are these guys doing in a dangerous dungeon?」</p>

<p>「Remove it properly」</p>

<p>　I froze at Rin’s unexpected suggestion.</p>

<p>　This is …… not good. I could feel the threads of my rationality tearing with a banging sound.</p>

<p>　I couldn’t calm down even if I thought of a Four Character phrase. I make a fist and smash the right side of my head with a hard thud!　</p>

<p>「Hiee!」</p>

<p>「Hee」</p>

<p>「What?」</p>

<p>「 He suddenly punched himself lol.」</p>

<p>「It sounded like iron colliding with iron.」</p>

<p>「Well, I’m sure his head and fists are harder than steel.」</p>

<p>「Don’t concentrate like you’re fixing an old appliance.」</p>

<p>　…… Okay, the annoyance is gone.</p>

<p>　With a quick wave of my hand, I removed the mucus from Rin’s chest. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>“Is everything okay now?”</p>

<p>“……Yes. Thank you.”</p>

<p>「Rin, you’re so cute when you sulk.」</p>

<p>「He got rid of his troubles by brute force, didn’t he?」</p>

<p>「But this is only a matter of time.」</p>

<p>「Why are we having a heroine race in a unique dungeon (joy)?」</p>

<p>　I manage to get over the biggest crisis and look at the wall.</p>

<p>　The main body of the Tentacle Slime must still be alive. If we began to fall, there’s a chance it would attack us again. It would be better to take it down firmly.</p>

<p>　I put down Rin, who I was holding in my arms, and tapped the wall with the back of my hand.</p>

<p>　Hmmm, this way?</p>

<p>“Sensei, what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m looking for slime. When you tap like this, you can tell what’s going on inside by the echo.”</p>

<p>　When I explained this, Rin imitated me, but she didn’t seem to understand what I was talking about.</p>

<p>　everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>「He’s doing sonar-like things himself, this guy.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka’s seriously not human.」</p>

<p>「What can’t this guy do?」</p>

<p>「Rin-chan is so confused.」</p>

<p>　I banged on the wall a couple of times while the comments were going wild, and found the main body of the Tentacle Slime.</p>

<p>　Then I went near the part and slapped the wall as hard as I could.</p>

<p>“Yo, tsu.”</p>

<p>　A shockwave travels through the wall and hits the main body of the tentacle slime.</p>

<p>　The tentacles of the Tentacle Slime can be cut many times, but the main body is fragile. The nucleus was torn to pieces by the single blow just now.</p>

<p>　The main body of the tentacle slime came out of the hole, but its body was so limp that it collapsed and died as soon as it came out.</p>

<p>” All right. That worked.”</p>

<p>「Instant kill, lol.」</p>

<p>「Didn’t you know?　You can’t escape Tanaka.」</p>

<p>「I feel sorry for the monster.」</p>

<p>「So scary lol.」</p>

<p>「Now they can go down there.」</p>

<p>「I was scared when I saw the unique dungeon, but after watching this stream, I feel a bit relieved.」</p>

<p>「I guess this stream is the reason why the panic isn’t as widespread as I thought it would be.」</p>

<p>「Indeed.」</p>

<p>「The number of people who have watched this stream is over 100 million again, and a lot of people from overseas are watching it.」</p>

<p>「We still don’t have 11.9 billion people watching, do we?　I’m sure it’s going to grow even more in the future.」</p>

<p>「The D-tube has an automatic translation function, so it’s easy for people from other countries to watch.」</p>

<p>「He’s really great!　I wish they would deploy him in the US!」 (English)</p>

<p>「Sorry. This corporate slave is for Japan.」</p>

<p>「If a foreign country NTRs me, I’ll never get over it.」(Tl: Simple terms, steal yo girl)</p>

<p>　I realized that the number of viewers had exceeded 100 million.</p>

<p>　I haven’t seen this much growth since that time I streamed by mistake.</p>

<p>　I was happy that more people are watching, but it was no time to be happy. I had to destroy this dungeon as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“We’ve spent quite a bit of time on this. Shall we hurry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s go.”</p>

<p>　Rin and I nodded to each other and fell back into the deep abyss.</p>

<p>……</p>

<p><a href="#fnref-1" id="fn-1">1</a>. Theyre Four Character Phrases/idioms, phrases (usualy but not always idiomatic) that have four characters (exists in both Chinese and Japanese). The ones here mean, in order: Clear the mind, All is vanity, but the last one is a little complicated, and has some history. It translates literally to A BBQ set meal, But is a parody on another Four Character Phrase that meant, “The weak are a meal for the strong”(Which is a very great quote), but two characters in the spelling have been replaced to give it its more tasty meaning 焼肉定食 -&gt; 弱肉強食. The common urban legend is that a student answered 焼肉定食 instead of the intended answer 弱肉強食, when he was asked to fill the blank in the following phrase □肉□食. Took me quite a while to get</p>
