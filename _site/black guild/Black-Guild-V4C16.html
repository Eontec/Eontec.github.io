<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>「Oh, you ate it！」</p>

<p>「Oh, yeah, he’s eating it lol.」</p>

<p>「What are you eating?」</p>

<p>「 He’s so happy to be doing a food report lmao」</p>

<p>「Can you eat Shoggoth?」
<!--more--> <br />
「Screw it！」</p>

<p>「He’s crunching!」</p>

<p>「No, he said in a past stream that he is indeed eating dungeon stuff, but ……」</p>

<p>“Well, is it safe to eat that ……?”</p>

<p>‘Teke……?”</p>

<p>「Rin-chan is really confused.」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun also looked like, “Are you sure it’s okay?” I’m so excited.」</p>

<p>「You’re turning into a moe character！」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun is also very upset.」</p>

<p>「I bet he didn’t think he was going to get eaten lol」</p>

<p>　I notice that Rin and Shoggoth were looking at me worriedly. (Tl: Imagine even the mnoster, “yo bro, you good?”)</p>

<p>　The commentary was flowing at a blistering pace, and it seems they are quite surprised that I ate it.</p>

<p>　Eating a monster is nothing special to me, but it’s a shocking sight to others.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. My stomach tingles a little, but I can digest it just fine.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are alright, doctor. …… Why did you eat all this stuff?”</p>

<p>“There are three advantages to eating monsters. One is that you can increase the amount of magic essence in your body. By eating monsters, you can take the magic essence in them into your body. The more magic essence you have, the stronger your body becomes. Of course, if you exceed the allowable amount of magic essence, you will suffer from magic essence intoxication, so you have to be careful about the amount you eat and the kind of monsters you eat.”</p>

<p>　I ate monsters because I was in need of food, but the first time I ate one, it was terrible.</p>

<p>　My body rejected it, and I spent three days in agony in the deepest layers of my body. I remember Suda was furious with me to death.</p>

<p>　But it strengthened my stomach, and the next time I ate it, I only had a slight stomachache. Now I can eat as if I were having a normal meal.</p>

<p>“And the second thing. By eating, you get to know the other side. This is a tricky one, though. From what I can tell, these shoggoths are resistant to all kinds of attributes. Fire, water, lightning, explosions, etc. don’t work at all. In addition, they are also resistant to blows, so only slashes will work. However, his body has a strong acidity, so even if you slice him normally, the blade will be ruined first. This is a nasty opponent.”</p>

<p>“Great …… you can even understand such things!”</p>

<p>「How can you know that much just by eating it!」</p>

<p>「Because it’s useless to use common sense to measure Shachiken. ……」</p>

<p>「You can tell by the texture of the tongue or something (appropriate).」</p>

<p>「Status open! (meal).」 (Tl: I’ll like to draw your attention that Shoggoth is literally not doing anything cuz it’s still trying to figure out what the hell just happened)</p>

<p>「By the way, Shoggoth-kun’s tolerance is amazing. No wonder the American army can’t beat him.」</p>

<p>「If he had resistance to explosions, modern weapons would be almost ineffective.」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun is so cute when he is told about his abilities, he is so proud of them.」</p>

<p>「It’s supposed to be a terrifying monster. ……」</p>

<p>“And third. The third thing is that by eating it, you can make yourself resistant to the ‘poison’ that the monster has. Of course, when you eat it, you will be poisoned by it, but if you can overcome that, you can gain resistance to it. I’ve eaten most of the poisonous monsters, so I’m almost never bothered by poison anymore. And I don’t have to carry around antidotes anymore.”</p>

<p>“I see. …… Poison is one of the most troublesome aspects of dungeon exploration. It’s fascinating to be able to build up a resistance to it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure how much I would like to see that. The most important thing to remember is that you can not only resist ordinary poisons, but also the “acid” that this thing has. It also makes you resistant to the “acid” that this thing possesses.”</p>

<p>　I slowly approach Shoggoth.</p>

<p>“In other words, his attacks are no longer effective against me.”</p>

<p>『Teke……!?』</p>

<p>　Shoggoth extended its tentacles toward me as I approached, and wrapped them around my body.</p>

<p>　The “Kavach” business suit I was wearing, a general-purpose business suit for all phases of combat, had the ability to reflect the resistance I had gained in the suit itself.</p>

<p>　In other words, now that I have gained resistance to Shoggoth’s acid, this suit will not dissolve in Shoggoth’s acid either.</p>

<p>　No matter how much time passed, even the clothes did not dissolve, so Shoggoth bent his large body as if tilting his head while looking at me.</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun, you’re confused, lol.」</p>

<p>「Why do you think you can build up a tolerance to acid just by eating it ……?」</p>

<p>「Don’t think, feel.」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth, you’re in trouble… Well, it seems that the only way he can attack is to melt them…」</p>

<p>「But Tanaka doesn’t have a way to attack it either, does he?　He can’t eat all of it.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure Shachiken can eat it.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure the viewers would be traumatized by that scene.」</p>

<p>　Shoggoth gripped me tightly with his tentacles, but that was not enough to crush me.</p>

<p>　Then Rin came running up to me, looking worried.</p>

<p>“Sensei, are you okay!　What should I do?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine, Rin. I already know how to beat this guy.”</p>

<p>　I extended the fingers of my right hand and released a hand sword.</p>

<p>　The tentacles that restrain me were cut off and I was released.</p>

<p>“If you can’t cut him with your sword, you can cut them with your bare hands, which are resistant to him.”</p>

<p>　I proceed toward Shoggoth, slashing at the many tentacles that attacked me. I even had leeway so eat some of the pieces.</p>

<p>　I’m getting used to the taste. I would like to have it with grated daikon radish for a refreshing taste.</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun is shivering lol」</p>

<p>「I can finally see the fear in  Shoggoth-kun’s eyes.」</p>

<p>「I think I’d probably have the same look in my eyes if I looked in the mirror.」</p>

<p>「American military power ＜＜＜＜The hand sword of Shachiken.」</p>

<p>「This guy is fighting while eating!」</p>

<p>「I wonder why it looks so tasty.」</p>

<p>「It’s going to melt in your mouth in an instant.」</p>

<p>『Tekeli-li!!』</p>

<p>　As I approached Shoggoth, he suddenly produced a huge mouth on his body and bit me.</p>

<p>　Inside the mouth was a row of huge fangs with distorted shapes. It looked like it still had some means of attack left.</p>

<p>　I pulled out the sword at my waist and swung it toward its mouth.</p>

<p>“Waga-ryu kenjutsu, sakuku!”</p>

<p>　Zan!　The huge mouth of Shoggoth was sliced open with a resounding sound.</p>

<p>　Shoggoth backed away from me, perhaps startled by the counterattack.</p>

<p>「He’s slashing with a sword after all!」</p>

<p>「What was that about building resistance?」</p>

<p>「You’re using a sword, lol」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun, ‘you have a surprising strategy’ (confusion).」</p>

<p>　The Wagaryu swordsmanship “SAKUZU” is a technique in which the sword is swung at high speed and the blade is clothed in a robe of wind.</p>

<p>　As a result, each time the sword is swung, the blade of the wind cuts through the opponent. This way, the blade never hits Shoggoth’s acid.</p>

<p>“I know most of you now. It’s time to end this.”</p>
