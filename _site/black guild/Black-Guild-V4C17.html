<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>『Tekeli-li‼︎』</p>

<p>　Shoggoth repaired his body that had been cut by me and rushed toward me with tremendous force.</p>

<p>　It seems that seeing that neither the acid nor the tentacle attack would work, it shifted to a strategy of crushing me. It’s a creature that I don’t even know if it has a brain, but it’s got a lot of wits about it.</p>

<p>「If you don’t give up yet, Shoggoth-kun, you’ll do your best」
<!--more--> <br />
「He’s got good spirit.」</p>

<p>「It’s Shoggoth-kun, he’ll be fine. I have high hopes for you.」</p>

<p>「he commenters are cheering for Shoggoth-kun lol」</p>

<p>「He’s a real natural disaster monster…….lol」</p>

<p>「He’s already a moe character…」</p>

<p>「Good luck to both of you!」</p>

<p>　I readied my sword and looked straight at Shoggoth.</p>

<p>　The wound I cut earlier had already healed nicely. It seemed that I couldn’t do any damage even if I slashed him normally. It would be impossible to defeat him without destroying the nucleus …… dungeon core inside his body.</p>

<p>　However, its body wasn’t translucent like a slime, it was completely black. From the outside, it’s impossible to tell where the core is.</p>

<p>　There is an option to eat it all up, but I’m not that hungry right now, so I’ll try something else.</p>

<p>“Waga-ryu kenjutsu, Reku-Uku.”</p>

<p>　I swung my sword and a vacuum wave was created, slicing Shoggoth’s body in half vertically.</p>

<p>　I look at Shoggoth’s body, which is now split in two, and see that the right half of his body, as seen from me, has been cut in half.</p>

<p>　The right half of Shoggoth’s body, as seen from my point of view, moved in an urchin-like motion and tried to attach itself to the left half of the body. There was no doubt that the nucleus of shoggoth was in the right half.</p>

<p>“Reku-Uku!”</p>

<p>　This time, the shoggoth was slashed sideways.</p>

<p>　This time, the lower half of the body begins to move.</p>

<p>“Retsu-ku, Reku-Uku, Reku-Uku.”</p>

<p>　So then I cut that half in half. And then another half, and another half, and so on, until Shoggoth’s body became smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun Is just getting cut lol」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun, you’re getting smaller and smaller. ……」</p>

<p>「Is the West Coast monster this easy …… am I dreaming?」 (English)」</p>

<p>「Niki abroad, cheer up.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure Shachiken will take care of the shoggoths in Niki’s country.」</p>

<p>「I don’t want to loan Tanaka overseas.」</p>

<p>「Even though Dojima-san is here, I’m afraid of losing Shachiken.」</p>

<p>「We should have a Shachiken per country.」</p>

<p>「That’s a little too end-of-the-century, don’t you think?」</p>

<p>「I’m afraid of too many.」</p>

<p>　After being slashed again and again, Shoggoth eventually became as small as a baseball.</p>

<p>When slashed again in that state, the dungeon core we first saw came out from its cross section.</p>

<p>「It’s out!」</p>

<p>「Core: “Hi”.」</p>

<p>「Core-kun, we finally met. ……」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun, I see your precious part, huh?」</p>

<p>「Good job, Shachiken!」</p>

<p>「You can do it, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「You’re kidding, right?　Are you really going to beat Shoggoth?」 (English)</p>

<p>「Oh, the mysteries of the Orient…….」 (Hindi)</p>

<p>「Even the Indians are looking at it.」</p>

<p>「Well, the Shoggoths have done a lot of damage. ……」</p>

<p>「I can’t keep up with all the comments.」</p>

<p>「I don’t know which language is which…」</p>

<p>「Hey! Hey!　I can’t keep up with all the comments anymore!」</p>

<p>　I stared at a nucleus the size of a marble.</p>

<p>　I can’t see the brittle part. Apparently, this core is quite hard.</p>

<p>　In addition, the core is a perfect sphere, almost a 『True sphere』.</p>

<p>　A sphere is highly resistant to impact, and it would be impossible to even scratch the core with a normal attack.</p>

<p>　However, there is no such thing as a perfect sphere in this world. There is always a flaw somewhere.</p>

<p>“I found it…….”</p>

<p>　We found a slight dent in one part of the core.</p>

<p>　It’s only a micron in size, but it’s enough to catch the tip of a sword.</p>

<p>　I hold the sword tightly in my right hand and point the tip toward the core.</p>

<p>　Shoggoth, perhaps sensing a danger to himself, looked at me, his eyeballs appearing in the core. Then two tentacles came out from the core and attack me.</p>

<p>『Teke‼︎』</p>

<p>　However, my blade reaches the core more quickly than the attack hits me.</p>

<p>“Tachibana-ryu kenjutsu, higan ippanshitsu.” (Tl: He did it)</p>

<p>　My blade, which had accurately pierced a slight depression in the core, made a clattering sound as it hit Shoggoth’s core!　With a sound, my blade shattered Shoggoth’s core with a single blow.</p>

<p>　At the same time, Shoggoth’s body crumbled and melts away.</p>

<p>『Tekeli.li……』</p>

<p>　Shoggoth stared at me until the moment he disappeared.</p>

<p>　There was no hostility in his eyes. I felt it was more of a friendly gaze.</p>

<p>“You were strong, but I can’t let you beat me in front of my cute little apprentice.”</p>

<p>『……teke』</p>

<p>　Shoggoth disappears with a final satisfied sound.</p>

<p>　Thus, my holiday workday comes to a successful end.</p>

<p>……</p>

<p>Tl Note: I really enjoyed translating this fight. First thing is the fact that there’s usually two line spaces between different parts, but when the slime replies them, it’s just one, like the slime is actually part of the conversation. It really makes Shoggoth feel like an actual character, rather than a random monster. Maybe it was mistake by the author. And Update, I’m going to be really busy next week(probably also won’t be with my laptop), so no updates, unless i can get stuff done on my phone, which honestly, I’d just be playing Call Of Duty Mobile on</p>
