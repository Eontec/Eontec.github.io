<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>「Yes!　Shachiken won!」</p>

<p>「Shachiken is the strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」</p>

<p>「Shoggoth-kun ……, we lost a great guy.」</p>

<p>「Stay tuned for what’s next for Shoggoth-kun」</p>

<p>「No, this is seriously bad. The U.S. and other countries are spending a lot of money to contain shoggoths in dungeons, and if someone …… is able to defeat them individually, the countries will move in.」
<!--more--> <br />
「I am a victim of shoggoth. I feel saved, thank you (English).」</p>

<p>「I’m really glad Tanaka was there. If Shoggoth had come out, Tokyo would have been destroyed.」</p>

<p>「Thank you, Tanaka!　Thank you so much!」</p>

<p>「I’m in the neighborhood, so I was really worried. I was really nervous because I live in the neighborhood, but I thought I’d be okay because Shachiken was there.」</p>

<p>「Thanks also to Minister Dojima, I’m sure he’ll say a lot of things in the Diet and at the press conference, but I’m rooting for him!」</p>

<p>「He has a very high approval rating, so I’m sure he’ll be fine, no one else can minister there.」</p>

<p>　After safely defeating Shoggoth, I take a deep breath.</p>

<p>　I was a little nervous because it was my first time fighting it, but I guess I did well. The comments were also very positive.</p>

<p>“…… Nn?”</p>

<p>　Suddenly, my feet shook, and the whole dungeon made a rumbling sound.</p>

<p>　It seems that the dungeon core was the right one that I broke earlier.</p>

<p>　When the core breaks, the dungeon breaks and returns to the state it was in before the dungeon was created. I haven’t figured out the principle yet, but the loss of the dungeon doesn’t cause subsidence.</p>

<p>　I really don’t know how it works.</p>

<p>“Wow, I have pieces of shoggoth on my clothes.”</p>

<p>　I noticed a black gooey substance on the belly of my suit.</p>

<p>　The other goo had dissolved when I killed Shoggoth, but for some reason this one was still there.</p>

<p>　I tried to brush it off with my hand, but it was stuck so tightly to the suit…… that I couldn’t get it off.</p>

<p>　I need to get out of here and leave it alone for the time being. I’ll just wash it in the washing machine and it will come off.</p>

<p>“Tekeri, ri.” (Tl: Shoggoth is an actual character confirmed, my deduction skills are impeccable, might as well call me Sherlock)</p>

<p>“Uh-huh?”</p>

<p>　I suddenly heard a shoggoth-like voice and looked around, but couldn’t find anything moving.</p>

<p>　Is it an auditory hallucination?　Shoggoth has the ability to pollute the mind, so maybe I’ve been affected by it. Maybe we should get checked out when we get back.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to get out of here first. If we stay in there, we’ll be flattened.”</p>

<p>　The dungeon attack ends when we get out of here.</p>

<p>　I ran up to Rin, who was watching the battle behind me.</p>

<p>“We need to get out of here, can we go?”</p>

<p>“……, yes!　Of course!”</p>

<p>　Rin looked at me for a moment and then went back to her normal self.</p>

<p>　Well, we faced an EX-ranked monster. It’s natural to be nervous.</p>

<p>「Rin-chan, you’ve fallen in love with him again, haven’t you?」</p>

<p>「You’re so cute with your red face.」</p>

<p>「This Uncle’s heart is pounding!」</p>

<p>「My heart is palpitating!」</p>

<p>「Why doesn’t he just push her down!　She’s waiting for it! (English)」</p>

<p>「I’m sure you’re not the only one who’s sensitive.」</p>

<p>「I’m not sure how to translate “insensitive” into English, but I’m not sure.　I’ll send you a separate comment with @.” (Tl: This is comedy gold, so I’ll add some of the raws here so you can get it)</p>

<p>「I think it’s ‘insensitive’.」 (「insensitiveらしい」)</p>

<p>「He’s very, very insensitive, okay?」 (「ヒーイズベリーベリーインセンシティブ、オーケー？」)</p>

<p>「Lmao.」</p>

<p>「I can’t tell if you’re competent or incompetent」 (Tl: Competent cuz he actually translted it to english. Incompetent, cuz then why katakana if you already literally have the english words?)</p>

<p>「Why are you using katakana?」</p>

<p>「Oh my god. ｜Now I understand.」</p>

<p>「You understand everything lol.」</p>

<p>「I have a translator, so send it to me in Japanese!」</p>

<p>　The dungeon was shaking violently, and Rin and I ran toward the hole we fell into.</p>

<p>　On the way there, Rin grunted in pain.</p>

<p>　Rin was covering her right leg as she ran. It seems that she had sustained some damage in the battle with Shoggoth.</p>

<p>“Rin, that leg ……”</p>

<p>　The hem of her right leg has melted and the skin underneath has turned red.</p>

<p>　It looks like Shoggoth’s splattered mucus has snagged it. My skin is a little tougher than other people’s, so I’m fine, but it would be a serious injury to a normal person.</p>

<p>　I’m trying to be patient, but it must hurt a lot.</p>

<p>“I’m fine with this kind of injury. I can’t bother you, Sensei……”</p>

<p>“No, no. I’m not just going to say, “Well, then you’re fine”. I’m glad you want to show me how much you’ve grown, but ……”</p>

<p>　When I approached Rin, I took the opportunity to hold her in my arms.</p>

<p>　The form is what is known as a “princess hold”. Rin was surprised and screamed, “Kya!”</p>

<p>“I want you to rely on me more freely. Teachers are creatures who want to be depended on by their students.”</p>

<p>“Sensei ……”</p>

<p>　Rin seemed to understand what I was saying and stopped resisting.</p>

<p>　Okay, now we’re ready to escape.</p>

<p>「We’re attacking again, ma’am.」</p>

<p>「Rin, you look too happy and cute.」</p>

<p>「Let’s set up the wedding hall here.」</p>

<p>「［¥30000］Here’s your wedding gift money.」</p>

<p>「Finish with a happy kiss.」</p>

<p>「I wish I could have been a student of Shachiken.」</p>

<p>「［¥50000］Is this where we’re going to have our spacha timing today?」</p>

<p>「［¥56000］My bank account is on fire!」</p>

<p>「You guys are so generous. I’ll pay it when they’re really married.」</p>

<p>「[$30000] What is it?　You want me to give you some money? (English)」 (Tl: The amount blew me away..)</p>

<p>「Gaijin niki!」 (Tl: Basically, a half slur meaning something like ‘Foreign Brother’)</p>

<p>「$30,000 lmao.」</p>

<p>「This is a thank-you Spacha party!」</p>

<p>“Wow, something is going on with Spacha.”</p>

<p>　Red letters fly wildly in the comment section, which is being shown on a three-dimensional image.</p>

<p>　In no time at all, the amount of money piled up to exceed my annual livestock income, and I stood scared before my joy. No, I’m grateful, but I wasn’t sure if I should be getting this much.</p>

<p>“Well, thank you to all of my viewers. If I were to do a thank you stream somewhere……  a wedding?　A congratulatory gift?　What are you talking about ……?” (Tl: He had to do a double take reading those comments)</p>

<p>As I was being dumbfounded by the meaningless comments, a large number of slimes were falling down from the hole above my head!</p>

<p>　It seems that the vibrations caused them to fall.</p>

<p>　When the slimes saw me, they jumped and shook their bodies, threatening me.</p>

<p>　It seems that they considered me an enemy.</p>

<p>“tto ……. I’ve been a little too distracted by the comments. I’ll get out of here as soon as I can. Hold on tight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Please.”</p>

<p>　Rin clung to my body tightly.</p>

<p>　The soft touch and the good smell of her body almost made my rationality jump out of my skin, but I held on with my steel mentality.</p>

<p>“Then, let’s get the hell out of here.”</p>

<p>　I kicked away the slimes that attacked me and began to escape from the dungeon.</p>

<p>……</p>

<p>Tl Note: Early Release cuz I’m not going to class today, and had to do something while i procastinate packing up my stuff</p>
