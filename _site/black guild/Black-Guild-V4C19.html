<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Ho, ho.”</p>

<p>　I was climbing the wall as the dungeon collapsed.</p>

<p>　The shaking was getting stronger and stronger, but well, at this rate I’d have time to escape.</p>

<p>「He’s walking on the wall like it’s normal, lol.」</p>

<p>「I’m not surprised by this anymore. ……」</p>

<p>「I’m not satisfied with the other streams anymore lol.」
<!--more--> <br />
「At the very least, you have to eat shoggoths.」</p>

<p>「Don’t do it because some people will copy you.」</p>

<p>「There’s no one who can beat shoggoths in the first place. ……」</p>

<p>「Tanaka’s list of things he’s done」</p>

<p>「Conquered the dungeon directly under the Imperial Palace and returned.」</p>

<p>「Helped several explorers in a dungeon where an anomaly occurred, and quelled the anomaly as well.」</p>

<p>「Destroy the unique dungeon and prevent shoggoth from getting out.」</p>

<p>「…… Maybe Shachiken is a hero?」</p>

<p>「It’s so crazy when it’s listed like this.」</p>

<p>「He deserves the National Medal of Honor.」</p>

<p>「I heard that this guy was a corporate slave.」</p>

<p>「Haha, that can’t be true. ……」</p>

<p>「Who was Suda really?」</p>

<p>　As I was running up the wall as fast as I could, slimes were slithering out of the holes in the wall.</p>

<p>　I didn’t know if they were panicking because the dungeon had started to collapse, or if they were angry at me for destroying it, but they were sure to get in the way.</p>

<p>　But my feet were gripping the wall and my arms were holding Rin in a princess’s arms, so I literally couldn’t do anything about it.</p>

<p>　As I wondered what to do, Rin twisted around and pointed her right hand toward the slime.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of this. Sensei, please go ahead without worrying about it.”</p>

<p>“Okay, I’ll leave it to you.”</p>

<p>　Rin nodded in agreement with my words. and then she launched the magic.</p>

<p>　The lightning shot out to fill the hole and vaporized the slimes in an instant.</p>

<p>“As expected. Thanks for your help, Rin.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not as good as you are.”</p>

<p>　Rin is very humble.</p>

<p>　But magic is very useful.</p>

<p>“If I could use magic too, I would be able to use a lot more tactics.”</p>

<p>「Are you still trying to get stronger (shudder)?」</p>

<p>「If Shachiken can even use magic, it’s over. ……」</p>

<p>「You mean the strongest physical character will be able to use buffs and ranged attacks?　That’s a bug.」</p>

<p>「He’s already a buggy character. ……」</p>

<p>「It’s a level of weakness that will be fixed.」</p>

<p>「God: “I made a mistake”.」</p>

<p>「You already made a mistake.」</p>

<p>　There was some kind of commentary going on, but I climbed the wall without checking.</p>

<p>　Occasionally pieces of debris would come swinging down, so I would jump on them and jump. It’s a little fun, a little athletic.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking about this, I finally saw the end of the vertical hole.</p>

<p>wa　After climbing up, the exit is just around the corner.</p>

<p>“……Sensei. Do you remember the first time I met you?”</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>　Rin suddenly started talking.</p>

<p>　What’s going on?</p>

<p>“I remember. When I first met you, I was surprised at your murderous intent toward me.”</p>

<p>“…… I’m really sorry. I am deeply sorry.”</p>

<p>　It’s hard to believe if you look at Rin now, but when I first met her, she was in a rough spot.</p>

<p>　I was not happy with my sudden hire as an instructor, and she often tried to pick fights with me, and I fought her off.</p>

<p>　I fought her off every time. After repeating this, she somehow became fond of me, but it was a tough time. When she attacked me while I was in the bathroom, I had to give her a lecture.</p>

<p>“There is a reason why I was so hostile to you back then. I was afraid that my sister …… Amatsuki would be taken away by Sensei.” (Tl: Indeed she was taken)</p>

<p>“…… I see. Is that so?”</p>

<p>　Rin was saved and protected by Amatsuki when she was being attacked by a monster.</p>

<p>　She has lived with Amatsuki ever since. The two are as close as sisters.</p>

<p>“I knew right away that my sister had feelings for Sensei. If they were by each other’s side, they might get attached, and then I might be thrown away. Thinking that foolishly, I fought many battles to get rid of Sensei. I thought that if I lost my family again, this time I would break myself…….”</p>

<p>　I didn’t know that Rin had thought that.</p>

<p>　I thought she just randomly wanted me dead, but it seems it was so she wouldn’t lose her family</p>

<p>　If you think about it calmly, you will realize that Amatsuki would never abandon her for such a reason, but Rin probably didn’t have the luxury of time because she just lost her family. Now Rin is an adult, but at the time she was still a child.</p>

<p>　…… I mean, even the child Rin noticed Amatsuki’s feelings for me? How insensitive can I be?</p>

<p>　I’m not sure how much I’m being insensitive.　Speaking of which, I’m still streaming right now, but is it okay to talk about this kind of stuff?　Especially about Amatsuki, isn’t it being streamed all over the country?</p>

<p>「[Good news] Chief Amatsuki, you were a heroine after all.」</p>

<p>「She’s always liked you, or she’s your childhood friend, right?」</p>

<p>「I saw an article that said they lived in the same neighborhood, but it looks like it’s true.」(Tl: Article? Bro has been streaming for a week max)</p>

<p>「This is the third heroine in the race. The heroine race is getting more and more exciting.」</p>

<p>「The battle of the wives has begun.」</p>

<p>「My money’s on Yui.」</p>

<p>「No, Shachiken will marry them all」</p>

<p>「Don’t forget the fourth heroine, Shoggoth!」</p>

<p>「There’s also Rin-kun!」</p>

<p>「There are too many heroines to choose from.」</p>

<p>　……It looks like it was already too late.</p>

<p>　If I could touch my phone I could mute it, but my hands are full right now. Besides, it wouldn’t make any sense to stop the stream now.</p>

<p>‘I fought with Sensei many times for my own selfish reasons. But you continued to go along with me. You accepted my selfish behavior, scolded me, and forgave me every time. As I kept repeating this, my anger toward Sensei disappeared. On the contrary, I began to miss …… Sensei.”</p>

<p>“Rin ……”</p>

<p>　And while I was listening to her story, I climbed out of the vertical hole.</p>

<p>　All that was left was to go out through the exit in front of us, and that would be the end of today’s business.</p>

<p>“If you had not faced me at that time, I would still be a child. Thank you so much, doctor. I’ve been …… yearning for you ever since that time.”</p>

<p>　I think Rin said this while looking me straight in the eye, and when I think she slowly raised her body, she put her arms around my neck and put her lips on my lips.</p>

<p>　Surprised by the suddenness, I tried to lean back, but I couldn’t escape because her arms were tightly wrapped around my neck.</p>

<p>「Rin-chan!」</p>

<p>「Yes!」</p>

<p>「Bold kisses are a girl’s privilege.」</p>

<p>「You’ve jumped to the top of the heroine race.」</p>

<p>「●REC!」</p>

<p>「I’m so jealous!」</p>

<p>「Take over, Rin-chan!」</p>

<p>「That way!」</p>

<p>「The viewers are still as cool as ever!」</p>

<p>「Yui seems really nervous.」</p>

<p>「Amatsuki seems to be in a hurry too.」</p>

<p>「Today’s stream has so much to offer, I’m dizzy.」</p>

<p>“……puha”</p>

<p>　Rin, after kissing me for a long time, released her lips and jumped off me with a jerk.</p>

<p>　Then, with her back to me, she spoke to me.</p>

<p>“……Thank you for today. It’s been a long time since I’ve had the pleasure of working with you.”</p>

<p>　Her tone was calm, but I could see from behind that her ears were bright red.</p>

<p>　It seems she was embarrassed after all.</p>

<p>“I look forward to seeing you again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hey Rin!”</p>

<p>　Rin ran away as if she was running away.</p>

<p>　When I followed her out of the dungeon,……, I found a large number of people there.</p>

<p>“The first thing that comes to my mind is that it’s a good thing that I’m here! It’s Shachiken!”</p>

<p>“Please let me interview him!”</p>

<p>“Let me at least take a picture!”</p>

<p>“Thanks for saving the city!”</p>

<p>“I was watching your stream!”</p>

<p>　There was a huge crowd of reporters and people from the city gathered near the entrance of the dungeon.</p>

<p>　The government people managed to stop it, but people were pouring in so fast that it could break at any moment.</p>

<p>“Haha, hello.”</p>

<p>　I managed to smile and greet them.</p>

<p>　This is great. I should probably leave before things get too crazy.</p>

<p>　Before I left, I looked around, but Rin was nowhere to be seen. It seems that she has already left this place.</p>

<p>　…… Even so, I had no idea that even Rin had taken a liking to me.</p>

<p>“You had the courage to tell me all that. I have to respond to it.” (Tl: A rejection, as it should be)</p>

<p>“Tekkuri.”</p>

<p>“Hmm?　Another auditory hallucination?”</p>

<p>　I looked around, but of course there was no sign of Shoggoth.</p>

<p>　On the contrary, the entrance to the dungeon from which I emerged rattled and completely collapsed. If the dungeon collapses, the monsters born there will die.</p>

<p>　Shoggoth will not survive …… probably.</p>

<p>　I checked my phone and received a message from Hoshino that she had left earlier.</p>

<p>　Then there was no more reason to stay there. The troublesome report to the government would have to wait until a later date.</p>

<p>　With that decision made, I headed home, hopping to get away from the crowds.</p>
