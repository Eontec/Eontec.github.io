<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　After finishing our meal at a cafe, we came to a certain place near the Sky Tree.</p>

<p>　The shopping street, lined with slightly old-fashioned stores, was a place I often visited.</p>

<p>“Wow. There are so many weapon shops…….!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>　As she said, this shopping district was lined with stores selling weapons, armor, and other necessities for explorers.
<!--more-->  <br />
　Hoshino seems to be using mass-produced goods made by big companies, so she’s never been to these privately owned stores.</p>

<p>“This is the Kappabashi Weapons District. It is the largest weapons shopping district in Tokyo. The prices are higher than those of weapons made by major companies, but because they are made from scratch by craftsmen, they fit me better. I’ll have Hoshino’s weapon made here today.”</p>

<p>　When I explain this to her as we walk in, Hoshino makes a quick happy face, then a dejected expression.</p>

<p>“Um, I’m very happy about the new weapon, but I can’t …… afford it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that. I’ll let you grab more materials for the mount dragon you got the other day. Hoshino won’t have to pay a penny.”</p>

<p>“Eh, Eeeh!　Are you sure about that?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino shouted loudly in surprise.</p>

<p>　The weapons are quite expensive, so it’s understandable that she would be surprised if they were free of charge.</p>

<p>　I didn’t pay a penny for weapons when I was a company employee, so this seems normal to me.</p>

<p>　Incidentally, the company didn’t pay me a penny. I secretly saved up the materials I picked up and bartered them to repair and improve my weapons.</p>

<p>　Thinking about it again, it’s too dark. I’m glad my brainwashing has been lifted…….</p>

<p>“…… and here. This is my go-to arms shop.”</p>

<p>　I stop in front of an old building at the end of the shopping street.</p>

<p>　The sign reads “Shiwa Blacksmith Shop” in cursive. The store’s appearance is old and makes me worry, but I am sure of his skill.</p>

<p>　Of all the skilled craftsmen in this shopping district, this is the blacksmith I trust the most.</p>

<p>“Rin, is this your first time here too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. The weapons I’m using are supplied by the First Defeat Section.”</p>

<p>　Rin nodded her head.</p>

<p>　 But they are not of the highest quality, so I may have to look into Rin’s weapons next time.</p>

<p>　Thinking about this, I opened the sliding door and walked in.</p>

<p>“Excuse me”</p>

<p>“…… hmm?　A customer?”</p>

<p>　As I entered, I saw the back of a person rummaging through a pile of weapons.</p>

<p>The person with soot all over their body turns around, looks at me, and raises the corners of their mouth in a happy smile.</p>

<p>“Look who it is, little Tanaka,　How are you?”</p>

<p>　With that, she …… Kaoru Shiwa bashes me on the back with her large leather-gloved hand. It was her way of expressing her affection, but it hurt a lot.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry to bother you. ……”</p>

<p>“Excuse me”</p>

<p>　Hoshino and Rin followed me into the store.</p>

<p>　When Kaoru-san saw them, she increased the strength of her pat on my back.</p>

<p>“Why did you bring all these lovely girls here?　You can’t leave them in the corner like that!”</p>

<p>“Kaoru,  san,  my,  back,  is,  breaking.”</p>

<p>　My bones started creaking and creaking, so I took a step back to avoid it.</p>

<p>　Like Dojima-san, the skinship of the older generation is too extreme.</p>

<p>　By the way, Kaoru-san is also an awakened person and a former explorer.</p>

<p>She is an old acquaintance of my master, Tachibana-san, and they used to dive together in the dungeon in the past. I also got acquainted with Kaoru-san through  Tachibana-san’s connection, and she has been taking care of my weapons for a long time.</p>

<p>“Hoshino, Rin. Let me introduce you. This is Ms. Kaoru Shiwa, who is my acquaintance and I always ask her to adjust my weapons.”</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you both. I’ll give a lot of service to a pretty girl.”</p>

<p>　Kaoru-san smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>　Hoshino and Rin introduced themselves to her and got to know each other better. Both of them were still a little nervous, but Kaoru-san is a very caring person, so they would soon get used to each other.</p>

<p>“Um, Kaoru-san, do you work as a blacksmith?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I am. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be dressed like this.”</p>

<p>　Kaoru answered Hoshino’s question.</p>

<p>　Kaoru-san was wearing a large apron and gloves made of leather. Made of demon material, it can withstand the high heat that melts the dungeon’s iron.</p>

<p>“It’s amazing,　It’s so cool to be a female blacksmith!”</p>

<p>“You say such nice things about me, Yui. How about I give you one of my favorite weapons?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino was puzzled by these unexpected words.</p>

<p>　If I let it go any longer, it might get complicated, so I interrupted her.</p>

<p>“Kaoru-san. It would be nice if you could give it to her, but I came here today to make her a weapon. Use this.”</p>

<p>　I take out a business bag from my pocket, take out a huge pulsating lump of rock from it, and put it on the big desk in the store.</p>

<p>　Kaoru-san sees it and smiles happily, “Heh”</p>

<p>“The heart of a mount dragon…… It’s a pretty good one, too. Is it an abnormally grown individual?”</p>

<p>“As expected of you. I’d like you to use it today to make Hoshino’s weapons and also to adjust mine.”</p>

<p>“All right, leave it to me. You’ll pay for it with the usual materials, right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m always sorry.”</p>

<p>　The truth is, it would probably be more helpful for Kaoru-san if I paid her properly, but unfortunately, I don’t have that much money right now.</p>

<p>　When I can earn money properly, I’ll have to make a lot of money for what I’ve spent so far.</p>

<p>“That’s fine. The materials Tanaka brings are of good quality. Now, hand over your weapons.”</p>

<p>　I handed my own sword and Hoshino’s sword that I had left with her in the morning to Kaoru-san.</p>

<p>　Kaoru-san carefully examined the two swords. Her eyes are that of a first-class craftsman.</p>

<p>“Yui, this sword is still usable, so I’m going to make a new one based on this one. Is that okay?”</p>

<p>“Ha, Yes, please!</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will make it a good sword, so just wait a little bit.”</p>

<p>　With that, Kaoru-san put Hoshino’s sword into a special furnace.</p>

<p>　Then Kaoru-san looked at me.</p>

<p>“You’re using the sword too hard. It’s a hard sword, but the edge of the blade is falling apart. How do you use a sword like this?　You didn’t cut a mount dragon in half, did you?”</p>

<p>“Haha, no way…….”</p>

<p>　I did my best to stay clear of the situation.</p>

<p>　It’s because Kaoru-san is scary when she gets angry,…….</p>

<p>“I’m sure it will be fixed in no time at all. Until then, you can try out your skills with that.”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Kaoru-san pointed to a corner of the store.</p>

<p>　There, a large dragon scale was fixed to the ground. Near it, several weapons were propped up.</p>

<p>“Is that ……?”</p>

<p>“It’s a scale to test your skill. If you can cut it in half with the weapons nearby, I will give you a prize.”</p>

<p>“Heh, Sounds interesting.”</p>

<p>　The scales on the table are shining blue.</p>

<p>　 It is a very tough dragon scale.</p>

<p>“She said there’s a prize!　Let’s try it too, Rin!”</p>

<p>“Ah, wait a minute!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino happily took Rin’s hand and went in front of the scales.</p>

<p>　Let’s see, I’m going to try it too.</p>
