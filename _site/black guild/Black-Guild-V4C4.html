<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“These are some fine scales.”</p>

<p>　I say as I look closely at the fixed sapphire dragon scales.</p>

<p>　When I lightly hit it with my fist, a high-pitched “kon” sound came out. Hmmm, it looks quite hard.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine one, but it’s not suitable for processing, so I’m keeping it. If I could crush it, I could use it as a knife or something.”</p>

<p>　Kaoru-san said as she polished my sword.
<!--more-->   <br />
　She was talking while she was polishing my sword, but her handiwork was superb. She is using the materials I gave her to repair and strengthen the sword.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you try first, Hoshino?”</p>

<p>　I waved to Hoshino, who looked most eager to try.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like to try!　Ah, I was also thinking, how about streaming this?　I’m sure everyone would enjoy it!”</p>

<p>“That would be fun. I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s suggestion caught my attention.</p>

<p>　She is a veteran streamer, so she has a lot of planning ability.</p>

<p>“But is Rin okay with being in the video?　If you don’t like it, feel free to say no.”</p>

<p>“No problem. I’ve been told by Minister Dojima to go to the media more to promote the Subjugation Division.”</p>

<p>“I see. Thank you. I’ll thank him again next time.”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Rin shook her head in a firm and determined manner.</p>

<p>“Kaoru-san, are you okay with it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m fine. Please promote this store as much as you can. Recently, the number of customers has been decreasing because of the big weapon manufacturing companies.”</p>

<p>“I understand. I will post the address of the store after the stream is over.”</p>

<p>　Then there would be no viewers who would try to harass me during the stream.</p>

<p>　After getting approval from everyone, I took out the drone that I had left in my pocket.</p>

<p>　The battery is still in ……. Thank goodness it was loaded with high-capacity batteries.</p>

<p>“Okay, then, let’s start streaming.”</p>

<p>　I operate my phone and start the drone. I’m still nervous at this moment.</p>

<p>　After a few seconds of advertising the start of the stream on social media, people started trickling in.</p>

<p>　Now that the channel has over a million subscribers, I don’t think it’s possible for people not to show up, but it’s still a relief when people show up properly.</p>

<p>「What?　You’re starting a stream?」</p>

<p>「Wakotsu.」 (Tl: Internet slang in Japan for greeting live broadcasters and streamers too ig)</p>

<p>「Thanks for the stream.」</p>

<p>「Shachiken’s here!」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　I’ve been waiting for you!」</p>

<p>「I’m so happy for the stream!」</p>

<p>「I’m off work!」</p>

<p>「This is no time to be messing around lol!」</p>

<p>　The comments are soon heated up.</p>

<p>　I clear my throat, switch to working mode, and start talking to the drone.</p>

<p>“Thank you for coming in today. As the title says, today I would like to challenge you to slay the scales of the sapphire dragon in this store. By the way, this store I am visiting today is my favorite blacksmith store. I will post the location of this store when I am done streaming, so it would be great if you could come.”</p>

<p>「Ok.」</p>

<p>「Ok.」</p>

<p>「k.」</p>

<p>「k」</p>

<p>「I’ll definitely go there.」</p>

<p>「Drop some money, you guys!」</p>

<p>「If they’re making weapons for Shachiken, they must be pretty trustworthy.」</p>

<p>「It’s a lot easier to go on a stroll than to visit a dungeon.」</p>

<p>“And I have two people I know with me today.”</p>

<p>　Saying that, I gestured to the two people in front of me who had been waiting behind the drone.</p>

<p>　First, Hoshino jumped in front of the drone.</p>

<p>“Hello!　I’m Hoshino Yui from Yui Channel!　I’m here today as a guest! Nice to meet you!”</p>

<p>「Yui-chan is here!」</p>

<p>「I’m glad to see that you and Shachiken are still going strong.」</p>

<p>「She’s too cute as usual.」</p>

<p>「I’m too jealous of Tanaka who can do whatever he wants with those big breasts. ……」</p>

<p>「Don’t worry, he hasn’t made a move on her yet.」</p>

<p>「Get your hands on her, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「Get your hands on me too, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>「As usual, the viewers here have a strange way of losing their temper.」</p>

<p>　The comments flow even faster when Hoshino is on the show. I’m glad to see that she’s popular.</p>

<p>　Next, Rin steps out in front of the drone.</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you all. My name is Rin Ayakawa, I belong to the Ministry of Monster Control, Monster Subjugation First Division. I look forward to working with you.”</p>

<p>「Who is this girl?　She’s so cute!」</p>

<p>「She was in the government stream the other day. I’m glad to see her again!」</p>

<p>「Yui, the cute one, and Rin, the cool one, are a seamless lineup: ……」</p>

<p>「They’re forming a harem lol. I’m so jealous.」</p>

<p>「Yui and Rin seem to get along well with each other. So cute.」</p>

<p>「I wonder how long she and Yui have been friends.」</p>

<p>「I want to breathe the air between them.」</p>

<p>「Too creepy. But I understand a little.」</p>

<p>「I wonder what Rin’s relationship is with Shachiken?」</p>

<p>「I think she called him sensei or something in the government stream.」</p>

<p>　Rin is just as popular as Hoshino. It kind of makes me happy too.</p>

<p>　As I’m thinking this, Rin reads the holographic comments projected next to the drone and begins to answer questions.</p>

<p>“When I first joined the Subjugation Division, I was indebted to Makoto Sensei. He taught me so many things. I have not seen him for a while, but my respect for him has not changed. So our relationship has been longer than that of Hoshino-san.”</p>

<p>「Shachiken, I didn’t know you did that too.」</p>

<p>「The humidity in the way you look at Tanaka is too high.」</p>

<p>「You’ve already been captured, haven’t you?」</p>

<p>「She’s so cute, it’s making my heart ache.」</p>

<p>「I’m having heart palpitations.」</p>

<p>「I like the heavy emotions of a cool, beautiful girl. It’s good for all ailments.」</p>

<p>「She’s mounting Yui, as usual.」</p>

<p>「This is a declaration of war, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「The First Wife War is about to begin.」 (Tl: Already won by Amatsuki)</p>

<p>「Take responsibility and get them all, Tanaka!」</p>

<p>　The comment section went wild.</p>

<p>　I hurriedly made a comment to Rin.</p>

<p>“Haha, you don’t have to worry about how long we’ve known each other, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,……, were the days when we were so intensely physical just for fun,……?” (Tl: Dojima thaught her well)</p>

<p>“No, that was just being challenged to a duel!　Don’t say it in a way that could be misinterpreted!”</p>

<p>「I called the police.」</p>

<p>「That’s a crime, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　You’re responsible for this!」</p>

<p>「It’s getting interesting.」</p>

<p>「Yui, you’re losing?」</p>

<p>「Shachiken is funny when he’s flustered.」</p>

<p>「Sapphire Dragon Scales …………」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun, you’ve been completely forgotten about.」</p>

<p>　I desperately plead my case and managed to clear up the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>　It would be much easier to stream the dungeon. ……</p>
