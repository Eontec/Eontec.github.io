<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“All right, let’s start with Hoshino.”</p>

<p>　I waved to Hoshino to get her back on her feet.</p>

<p>　Hoshino answered with a spirited “Yes!” and picked up the biggest sword among the weapons prepared.</p>

<p>　It is similar in size and shape to the sword she normally uses. That one would give her her usual power.
<!--more--></p>

<p>「It’s amazing that she can hold such a big sword so easily.」</p>

<p>「She’s a power fighter with a cute face.」</p>

<p>「A frog’s child is a frog. The disciple of a fighter is a fighter.」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun, are you okay?」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun, run!」</p>

<p>「Sapphire dragons are famous for their hard scales, what will happen to them?」</p>

<p>　The comments were also excited about whether or not Hoshino could cut the scales. It was the right decision to stream the event.</p>

<p>　Hoshino held her sword in the upper stance and mentally unified herself in front of the scales.</p>

<p>　She closed her eyes for a while, and when she opens them, she mutters a small, “I’m going.”</p>

<p>“Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”</p>

<p>　She sent the strength she had built up in her legs to her arms and swung them as hard as she could.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was performing at a very high level what I had taught her before. It seems that she had continued her training after we parted.</p>

<p>　The sword swung down with tremendous force, hitting the scales and making a loud “bang!”. Hoshino’s arm strength was so great that the building shook unsteadily.</p>

<p>「Whoa!」</p>

<p>「The sound is so loud!」</p>

<p>「My eardrums are broken!」</p>

<p>「The force is so strong!」</p>

<p>「Is power no. 2 alive and well ……?」</p>

<p>「’Scale-kun!」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun is dead!」</p>

<p>「I’m jealous of Scale-kun’s popularity.」</p>

<p>　Brushing away the dust that flutters down from the ceiling, I checked on Scales.</p>

<p>　The scales that Hoshino had slashed with all her might were standing there without a single …… scratch on them.</p>

<p>“Ah, what?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino tilted her head curiously to see if there was a response.</p>

<p>　Unfortunately, the challenge failed.</p>

<p>「Scale-kun, you’re too hard lol.」</p>

<p>「Yeah …… that’s no good ……?」</p>

<p>「Scales, it doesn’t work, it’s a dragon.」</p>

<p>「Well, Sapphire Dragon is an S rank monster. It’s still not good enough.」</p>

<p>「Scale is too handsome. I’ll join the community.」</p>

<p>　While the comments are heated, Rin steps forward, “I’ll go next.”</p>

<p>In her hands, she held two daggers that had been prepared for her.</p>

<p>　Hoshino, on the other hand, came over with a squishy face, “It was no good.”</p>

<p>“It was close. You’re on the right track.”</p>

<p>“Ugh. …… thank you. …….”</p>

<p>　I encouraged her and she regained some of her energy, but she still looked frustrated.</p>

<p>　I’ll teach her more later on.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking that, Rin’s preparations were complete.</p>

<p>“I’m going to go to …….”</p>

<p>　Rin, holding two daggers in a cross, swung them at the same time, crossing them.</p>

<p>　It was a fast, sharp blow. The two daggers hit the same spot on the scale at the same time, making a high-pitched sound, and the surface of the scale chipped off a little with sparks.</p>

<p>　Yes, it was a well-targeted attack. Rin has also improved her skill.</p>

<p>「Haha!」</p>

<p>「Seriously, I couldn’t see the sword.」</p>

<p>「Rin, you’re really strong too.」</p>

<p>「I thought that combatants are drawn to each other.」</p>

<p>「The first division is an elite group of fighters, you know?　It’s only natural that they’re strong.」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun ……」</p>

<p>「Scales: “See, it’s no use.”」</p>

<p>「It worked!」</p>

<p>「But it didn’t cut it off, did it?」</p>

<p>「What, Shachiken is still waiting in the wings. Scale-kun’s fate is probably over there.」</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to have shown you my disappointment, …….”</p>

<p>　Rin comes back with eyes downcast and a regretful look on her face.</p>

<p>“Not at all. Rin did a pretty good job, too. You’re getting stronger, I’m happy for you.”</p>

<p>“Sensei ……”</p>

<p>　After I comforted Rin, I went to the front of the scales.</p>

<p>“Both of you have become much stronger than before, that’s the truth. There is no need to be discouraged. To begin with, sapphire dragons are usually attacked not on the back, where the scales are, but on the belly, where there are no scales. Just because you can’t cut it doesn’t mean you can’t beat a sapphire dragon.”</p>

<p>　No monster, even an S-rank monster, is perfect. Even if you can’t beat them head on, you can easily beat them by hitting their weak points. Of course, it is better to be able to beat them head on.</p>

<p>“What the two of you lack is ‘aim’. When cutting something as hard as this, attacking in the dark is not effective. You have to find out where the scales are weak. Do you know that there are parts of the same body that are weak against impact and parts that are strong?”</p>

<p>“Yes, somewhat. ……”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I can’t completely identify them yet, though.”</p>

<p>　They nodded. They seem to understand somewhat from past experience.</p>

<p>「I don’t get it, grass.」</p>

<p>「How do you know?」</p>

<p>「Sorry. I don’t have a clue about the language of the fighting people.」</p>

<p>「What are they talking about, ……?」</p>

<p>「Even if they were, how would you tell them apart?」</p>

<p>　A lot of puzzlement flows through the comments.</p>

<p>　Well, this is difficult because it’s a sensory thing. But it’s a skill you’ll want to learn if you’re going to be fighting S-ranked monsters down the road.</p>

<p>“It might be hard, but you’ll learn to recognize it. In the beginning, you can touch it with your hands. Things have fine invisible lines …… ‘eyes’. If you put the blade along those lines, you can easily cut anything.”</p>

<p>　I read the “eyes” on the scales as I touch them with my hand.</p>

<p>　Everything has an eye, just like wood has a grain. Aiming there,……, I release my hand blade.</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>　As soon as my hand sword hits the shiny blue scales, it cuts the scales in two.</p>

<p>　The scales roll to the floor with a thud, and Hoshino and Rin open their eyes wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>

<p>「He’s not using a weapon, lol.」</p>

<p>「It’s beyond awesome, it’s gross.」</p>

<p>「[Sad news] Shachiken’s hand sword is stronger than a real sword.」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun’s spazzy.」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun!」</p>

<p>「Scale: “I’m dead.”」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun …… was a good guy.」</p>

<p>「I’m sure they’re both a bit taken aback by this…」</p>

<p>「No, they’re making faces like they’re in love with him.」</p>

<p>「Combatants are attracted to strong men, you know.」</p>

<p>「Scales: “I’m in love with you too.”」</p>

<p>「I hope he goes to heaven.」</p>

<p>　I thought it would be a lot of fun, so I tried it with my bare hands, and it was more fun than I imagined it would be.</p>

<p>　It’s nice when things go as intended.</p>
