<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Kaoru-san. I was able to cut the scales, so can I have the prize?”</p>

<p>　I talk to Kaoru-san, who is watching me as I sharpen my sword, having successfully slashed the scales. I was excited, wondering what on earth I would get. However, I was not sure what she was talking about,</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? I told you that I would give you a prize if you cut with a weapon.　No bare hands.”
<!--more-->  <br />
“What?　Is that even a thing?</p>

<p>　I was surprised by Kaoru-san’s unexpected words.</p>

<p>　The comments were full of laughter, such as “lmao” and “surely”. Just like with Dojima-san, adults are sneaky.</p>

<p>　As I was feeling down, Kaoru-san opened her mouth with a laugh and said.</p>

<p>“I’m just kidding. Don’t take it seriously. I’ll make blades out of the scales for the number of people in your party as an apology, so can you break them up a little finer?</p>

<p>“Are you sure you don’t mind making one for the both of us?　Thank you!”</p>

<p>　I happily began crushing the sapphire dragon scales with my fist.</p>

<p>　These scales are difficult to process, but if I shatter them and attach a handle to them, they become a sharp knife. It is too small to be used as a main weapon, but it is easy to handle as an emergency weapon. I’m sure they’ll both be glad to have it.</p>

<p>「Oh, Scale-kun is in pieces …….」</p>

<p>「You’re crushing it with your fist, lol.」</p>

<p>「That’s usually crushed by arm strength, right?　What was that about looking them in the eye?」</p>

<p>「I’m sure it can be crushed by arm strength as well, just because it’s so easy to break. No, why can he crush it?」</p>

<p>「Scale: “let’s meet again …… you guys …….”」</p>

<p>「Scale-kun was a …… good guy, although his hardness wasn’t his best quality. ……」</p>

<p>「This was another divine episode. Thank God there were no surprises.」</p>

<p>「I think we’re almost done with today’s stream.」</p>

<p>　I crushed the scales into small pieces and placed them near Kaoru-san.</p>

<p>　Now, all I have to do is wait for Kaoru-san to finish her work. Now that there’s nothing left to do, maybe it’s time to cut the stream. I could do a chat stream, but I don’t feel like I can expand the conversation too much.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking that, I suddenly heard a loud beep from Rin’s phone!　A loud beep sounded from Rin’s phone.</p>

<p>“It’s —-!”</p>

<p>　Rin hurriedly pulls out her phone and runs her eyes over the screen.</p>

<p>　Then, as if with a grim look on her face, she suddenly takes off the clothes she was wearing.</p>

<p>「It’s visible.」</p>

<p>「It’s visible.」</p>

<p>「It’s visible.」</p>

<p>「Watch.」</p>

<p>「REC.」</p>

<p>「Look.」</p>

<p>　The viewers lean forward.</p>

<p>　However, contrary to their expectations, she does not expose her skin. Underneath her clothes, the uniform of the First Defeat Section appears.</p>

<p>　Where in the world did she hide this under those clothes? Did she use some kind of quick-change magic?</p>

<p>“Sensei. I am sorry, but I must leave you here.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?　You were called?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t think I’ll be able to come back today, so please enjoy the rest of the day with the two of you.”</p>

<p>　Saying this, Rin walked towards the entrance of the store.</p>

<p>　Although she is trying to look calm, she seems to be in some kind of a hurry.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?　If it’s an emergency, I can help you.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to bother you, Sensei. Well then…”</p>

<p>　Rin opened the door and disappeared from the scene in an instant.</p>

<p>　Rin has always been one of the fastest of the awakened. Now she seemed to be even more polished.</p>

<p>　Rin is a first-class warrior. I don’t think she’s going to fall behind no matter what happens,……, but I have a bad feeling about this.  I’m worried.</p>

<p>　Security is not good these days, can we really leave her alone?</p>

<p>「What’s going on, Rin?」</p>

<p>「What?　An incident?」</p>

<p>「Well, it seems there was some kind of commotion near the former Skytree site.」</p>

<p>「What?　Near the site?」</p>

<p>「It hasn’t made the news yet, but people are talking about it on social media.」</p>

<p>「Oh my god. Rin, will you be okay?」</p>

<p>　If we are to believe the comments, it seems that something happened near the former Skytree site.</p>

<p>　That’s why they called Rin who was near the site.</p>

<p>　If it’s true, I’d like to go after her, but it’s also bad to leave …… Hoshino behind. I can’t just do something that cruel to her.</p>

<p>　As I was wondering what to do, I suddenly got a push on my back.</p>

<p>“Eh ……?”</p>

<p>　When I turned around, I saw Hoshino there.</p>

<p>　With a somewhat uneasy smile on her face, she says.</p>

<p>“If you’re worried about me…… I’ll be fine; Please go.”</p>

<p>“But …….”</p>

<p>　When I tried to argue with her, Hoshino shook her head and stopped me.</p>

<p>You’re a hero to me, Tanaka-san. So I won’t get in your way. Please take care of Rin-chan</p>

<p>　With that, Hoshino bowed her head.</p>

<p>　If she goes this far ……, I can’t help but go.</p>

<p>“Tanaka!　Take this with you too!”</p>

<p>　Something suddenly flew toward me, spinning.</p>

<p>　I caught it and found it was my sword. Of course, it was Kaoru who threw it.</p>

<p>“Just as a princess needs a glass slipper, a prince needs a sword, right?　I took good care of it, so use it to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p>　Kaoru-san said with a manly smile.</p>

<p>　I pulled out half of the sword and checked the blade. With this, it seems I can cut anything.</p>

<p>　I bowed to Kaoru-san and said, “Thank you very much,” and left the store.</p>

<p>　Naturally, Rin was nowhere to be found. Well, I’ve got to find her fast. ……</p>
