<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　There was a shadow running at high speed over the roofs of the Kappabashi Weapon Shopping District.</p>

<p>　The speed of the figure was so fast that people walking in the street could not even catch it.</p>

<p>“……What I just saw was a first-class emergency call. I didn’t think that something that big was happening so close by.”</p>

<p>　That fast-moving figure, Rin Ayakawa, checked the current situation on her phone with a grim look on her face.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Is it an act of destruction by multiple awakened people ……?  This could be a serious situation if left unchecked.”</p>

<p>　The Labyrinth Liberation Church “Q” is a religious group with a large number of followers.</p>

<p>　The group, which has dangerous ideas and the financial power and energy to realize those ideas, had a major incident a few years ago that led to its general disbandment by the government.</p>

<p>　However, it is still active behind the scenes and is a troublesome group that occasionally commits such acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>“Labyrinth Liberation ……? I don’t know how screwed up people think.”</p>

<p>　As the name of the Labyrinth Liberation Order suggests, their supreme goal is to liberate the labyrinth ……, or dungeon.</p>

<p>　In other words, they are in direct conflict with the government that manages dungeons.</p>

<p>　They consider the dungeon sacred and are willing to commit acts of terrorism in order to free the dungeon from the hands of man. Many people have lost their lives as a result of their actions.</p>

<p>“What are they doing there, where there is no dungeon at the site of the former Skytree ……?”</p>

<p>　Rin rushed to the scene, muttering to herself.</p>

<p>　The place where we used to meet a few hours ago was in a state of complete disarray.</p>

<p>　Buildings were damaged, fires were raging, and people were running away, screaming and crying.</p>

<p>　The culprits creating such a hellish scene were men dressed in suspiciously black costumes.</p>

<p>　They covered their faces with a cloth, like ninja. Instead, the word “Q” was written in large letters on the cloth. The letters were the best proof that they were members of the Labyrinth Liberation Order “Q”.</p>

<p>　After confirming the enemy, Rin connected the call to the headquarters of the First Subjugation Division and made a short report.</p>

<p>“This is Rin Ayakawa of the First Subjugation Division. I’ve confirmed a member of the Labyrinth Liberation Church “Q” at the crime scene. I will now begin suppression action.”</p>

<p>　Rin leapt from the roof and pulled two swords from her waist.</p>

<p>　The goal would be to get the cult members who are trying to attack civilians. There are many awakened people in the cult, it would be difficult for ordinary people to even escape.</p>

<p>”—- Grant・Lightning.”</p>

<p>　By manipulating the magic essence in her body, Rin produced lightning and clothed her sword with it.</p>

<p>　The granting of lightning not only increases the power of the sword by lightning, but also enhances one’s physical abilities by boosting one’s own body with electricity.</p>

<p>　In particular, the increase in speed is unrivaled by any other attribute. Combined with her original Rin speed, her speed reaches a level that even an awakened person cannot capture.</p>

<p>“Imitation Sword, Blink —-“ (Tl: Hey it’s Tanaka’s thing. Now it’s  believable that she’s his student)</p>

<p>　When she touched down on the ground, she kicked the ground with such force that the ground caved in, and accelerated rapidly.</p>

<p>　The technique was a reinterpretation of something her teacher had once shown her, but arranged in her own way.</p>

<p>“Twin lightning blades!”</p>

<p>　Two streaks of lightning crawling on the ground strike the cultists.</p>

<p>　”Nn?” By the time they realized it, it was too late. She was approaching so fast that they could not even react and were knocked down.</p>

<p>“Gaaaah!”</p>

<p>　Rin cut down three enemies in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>　The wounds from the slash were shallow, but lightning was flowing at the moment of the slash, which caused the members of the cult to faint and fall over.</p>

<p>　After confirming their safety, Rin calls out to the citizens who failed to escape.</p>

<p>“It is dangerous here!　Please leave this place quickly!”</p>

<p>　The civilians follow Rin’s words and flee.</p>

<p>　As Rin sent them off, a cult member with a large club attacked her.</p>

<p>“Release the labyrinth!”</p>

<p>　The man swung his club down, shouting the words of the cult’s creed.</p>

<p>　Rin dodged his attack, leaping with the grace of a ballet dancer, and then slammed her palm into the side of the man’s head.</p>

<p>“Blitz Palm!”</p>

<p>　A magical thunderbolt strikes the man’s head.</p>

<p>　The impact was so great that the man was blown away at a tremendous speed and slammed into a wall. The man let go of his consciousness.</p>

<p>　Rin landed on the ground and turned her attention to the rest of the cult members.</p>

<p>“You are all under arrest for destruction of property, assault, violation of the Special Law for Awakened Persons, and a host of other charges.”</p>

<p>　Rin held up her sword.</p>

<p>　Then, the person who seems to be the leader among the cult members opened his mouth behind the cloth that hid his face.</p>

<p>“That uniform …… is the first subjugation division, right? You government dog, you talk big. We’re cleaning up your mess, you know?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense are you spouting ……?”</p>

<p>　Rin frowned at his extremely rude words.</p>

<p>“What do you think?　The dungeon has a power beyond human understanding. The power of the dungeon is truly the work of God!　It is not something that humans are allowed to manage.”</p>

<p>“If …… people don’t manage it, it will only increase the number of victims unnecessarily. Are you asking me to overlook that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. It’s called a necessary sacrifice.”</p>

<p>　Rin gritted her back teeth at this extremely self-centered assertion.</p>

<p>　She had lost her family to a monster disaster in the past, so their words were unacceptable to her.</p>

<p>“We denounce them!　We denounce those who foolishly try to control the labyrinth!</p>

<p>　We redeem!　We embrace the labyrinth to truly save people and move them to the next level!</p>

<p>　And we are Question!</p>

<p>　That is the creed of our labyrinth liberation cult “Q”. You government dogs will never understand.”</p>

<p>“……Yes, I don’t even want to know.”</p>

<p>　Rin was about to run out of the room as if she was done talking.</p>

<p>　But her legs stopped when she saw something.</p>

<p>“You ……!”</p>

<p>　Rin’s face was dyed with anger.</p>

<p>　What she saw ahead was a little girl who had been captured by the cultists.</p>

<p>　She must have been about five years old. Tears were welling up in her eyes, probably because she was so scared.</p>

<p>“It was a noble sacrificee to accomplish a noble mission. Now, put down that dangerous weapon.”</p>

<p>“Ku…..!”</p>

<p>　Rin let go of the weapon with a pained expression on her face.</p>

<p>　The rope rolled on the ground with a high pitched clang.</p>

<p>“Ah now that the dangerous elements have been neutralized, let’s reach our goal. Are the measurements complete?”</p>

<p>“Yes, leader. The labyrinth compatibility value here is higher than the others. I think we have a good chance of success.”</p>

<p>　The leader of the cultists, who said, “I see,” to the words of his subordinate who was measuring something with a suspicious-looking machine, produced a small round ball from his pocket.</p>

<p>　At first glance, it looked like a seed of a plant. While Rin tilted her head in puzzlement, the man buried the seed-like object in the spot where the Sky Tree once stood.</p>

<p>“Now, history will be changed.”</p>

<p>　Seconds after planting the seed, an earthquake suddenly shook the area they were in.</p>

<p>　After the shock, as if something huge was moving underground, something grew out of the place where the seed was planted.</p>

<p>　Rin was astonished to see it, and beads of sweat formed on her forehead.</p>

<p>“Stupid ……!”</p>

<p>　What Rin saw was the entrance to a dungeon.</p>

<p>　They had created a new dungeon.</p>

<p>　It was impossible to artificially create a dungeon. Rin had never heard of such a case before.</p>

<p>　But it had happened right before hiereyes.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful. Another labyrinth is born in our world. If we keep creating more and more labyrinths at this rate, mankind will surely be saved!”</p>

<p>　The cult members laughed loudly.</p>

<p>　If they are left unchecked, not only Japan but the world would come to an end. Rin intuits that this is the case and tried to exploit their carelessness.</p>

<p>　But at that moment, a gun was pointed at her.</p>

<p>“Oops, watch out. Don’t move. There are hostages over here.”</p>

<p>　The cultist brought the girl forward as if to show her off. He pointed the gun at her temple.</p>

<p>“This gun and bullets are made from minerals found in the labyrinth. Naturally, it will work on you.”</p>

<p>“Damn ……!”</p>

<p>　Rin gritted her teeth at the situation that she was facing.</p>

<p>　The situation would have been manageable if the other party had not been an awakened person and if there had been no hostages.</p>

<p>　　Rin could not think of a way out of this situation.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re busy ….. so it’s time for you to disappear. You got to see the birth of a new labyrinth, no regrets, right?”</p>

<p>　The leader of the cultists put his finger on the trigger.</p>

<p>　If it hit, death is inevitable. On the verge of death, Rin remembered someone she cared about.</p>

<p>“Sensei …….”</p>

<p>　She bit her lip and kept her eyes down.　</p>

<p>　She hated herself for her lack of strength.</p>

<p>“Farewell, you foolish apostate.”</p>

<p>　A bullet was unleashed mercilessly.</p>

<p>　The bullet flew straight at the head of Rin, who was lying on the ground, and just before it hit her, it snapped her in half!　</p>

<p>　The bullet, which was cut cleanly in two, sliped past Rin and buried itself in the wall behind her.</p>

<p>　The cultists, unable to comprehend what just happened, let out a “Huh?” in a stupefied voice.</p>

<p>　Rin, also unable to grasp the situation, slowly opened her eyes, and to her surprise, there was the back she had been chasing.</p>

<p>　The man dressed in a business suit and holding a sword at the ready was the person she had been most attracted to.</p>

<p>“Sensei ……”</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late. I’m glad I could make it.”</p>

<p>　The next thing Tanaka did was to pat Rin on the head and then turn his attention to the cult members.</p>

<p>　The expression on his face was cold and frightening, unlike the gentle one he had on Rin’s.</p>

<p>“…… How dare you point a gun at my pretty student?”</p>

<p>　A cold, murderous atmosphere filled the surrounding area.</p>

<p>　The killing intent was so fierce that the cult members felt as if they had a blade pressed against their throats.</p>

<p>“Come at me. I’ll make you all regret your birth.” (Tl: Serious Tanaka?)</p>

<p>….</p>
