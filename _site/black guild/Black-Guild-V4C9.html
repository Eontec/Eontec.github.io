<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　Tanaka lowered himself and assumed the iai posture.</p>

<p>　The hands of the cult member holding the gun trembled as he saw this.</p>

<p>“There’s no way he can reach ……”</p>

<p>　The distance between the two was far enough. Besides, one was holding a sword and the other a gun.
<!--more-->  <br />
　It was obvious which attack would hit first.</p>

<p>　But the …… cult member felt as if he were being backed into a corner.</p>

<p>“Ha, he’s bluffing!”</p>

<p>“Then give it a try.”</p>

<p>　Tanaka said without hesitation. In contrast to him, the cult member was in a state of extreme tension. It was hard to tell which one of them was the hostage.</p>

<p>　The leader of the cult members reprimanded him, “Calm down!” but his voice did not reach them.</p>

<p>　The cultist looked at Tanaka and put his finger on the trigger of the gun.</p>

<p>He puts his finger on the trigger of the gun,</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s do it!”</p>

<p>　His grip on the gun tightened.</p>

<p>　Tanaka did not miss that moment.</p>

<p>“Waga-ryu kenjutsu, shun!” (Tl: Shun is what I’ve been translating as Blink, Which is better?)</p>

<p>　With a puff, Tanaka’s figure disappeared.</p>

<p>　`Waga-ryu Kenjutsu, Shun. The technique is to approach and cut the opponent in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>　Tanaka intentionally provoked his opponent and made him nervous, which increased the number of times he blinked. Now, when the moment when his body became tense coincided with the blink of an eye, he moved to attack.</p>

<p>　Using his well-trained leg strength sparingly, Tanaka closed the distance of 20 meters in an instant.</p>

<p>　And before his opponent could even notice him, he drew his sword from his waist.</p>

<p>　A flash of his sword cut the cultist’s gun in two.</p>

<p>　The cultist, realizing something is wrong, reflexively pulls the trigger, but the gun is no longer capable of being used as a gun, and nothing happens but a metallic clang.</p>

<p>“Whaa……!”</p>

<p>“Let’s get that boy away from you.”</p>

<p>　Tanaka released his iai, spun the sword in his hand, and struck the left shoulder of the cult member with the other side of the blade, the peak, as hard as he could.</p>

<p>　Even though the sword had no blade, it could be a deadly enough weapon when wielded with Tanaka’s brute strength.</p>

<p>　Tanaka’s sword severed the cultist’s trapezius muscle, snapped his collarbone, and shattered his sternum as it reached his left chest. This caused the cultist’s left shoulder to cave in significantly.</p>

<p>「Shachiken, you’re too fast!」</p>

<p>「That move looked like a bug move.」</p>

<p>「Suck it up, you cultist!」</p>

<p>「That’s not the Peak Strike I know.」</p>

<p>「Peak Strike (Deadly)!」</p>

<p>「Don’t worry. It’s a Peak Strike」</p>

<p>「I don’t feel safe at all.」</p>

<p>“Arrgh, ………”</p>

<p>　A member of the cult lets out a cry of anguish.</p>

<p>　The left shoulder was shattered, and naturally the left hand that was holding the hostage became unusable, and the cultist let go of the hostage.</p>

<p>　Tanaka quickly pulled the girl away from the cultist and kicks the dazed cultist to safety.</p>

<p>“It’s all right now, you did a good job.”</p>

<p>“Ha, yes. …….”</p>

<p>　She says this as she looks at the girl, and the girl jumps into Tanaka’s chest with tears in her eyes. The fear that had been suppressed until now seems to have overflowed.</p>

<p>　Tanaka rubbed the girl’s back and soothed her while holding her.</p>

<p>　The cult members all point their guns at Tanaka at once.</p>

<p>“Kill him!　Shoot him!”</p>

<p>　The leader of the cult shouted, and all the cult members opened fire on Tanaka.</p>

<p>　The seven cult members fired dozens of bullets. Tanaka thinks of a way to deal with the bullets before they reach him.</p>

<p>　He uses his sword to knock out all the bullets.</p>

<p>　—- is possible, but the ricochets could hit the girl. Rejected.</p>

<p>　Evade while holding the girl.</p>

<p>　—-The girl may not be able to withstand the speed at which she is moving. Rejected.</p>

<p>　After rejecting several ideas that came to his mind, Tanaka comes up with a way to get out of this situation without hurting the girl.</p>

<p>　Tanaka opens his hands and puts them out in front of him.</p>

<p>　He then caught all of the dozens of bullets that flew at him with his bare hands.</p>

<p>“Ba, idiot!”</p>

<p>　The leader of the cult members was astonished and pulled the trigger until the bullets ran out.</p>

<p>　But Tanaka moves his hand at high speed and finally catches all the bullets.</p>

<p>「He’s stopping bullets, lmao.」</p>

<p>「The guys in the cult are stunned.」</p>

<p>「This is the world of the Matrix.」</p>

<p>「This won’t hurt the girl, but do you want to do it?」</p>

<p>「Shachiken is the best!　Shachiken is the best!」</p>

<p>「This girl is going to be in the harem in ten years, I get it.」</p>

<p>「You can’t have a crush on a boy in your class anymore, can you? It’s going to destroy your brain.」</p>

<p>「You’re brain is broken too, so we’re all the same.」</p>

<p>　When the rain of bullets stops, Tanaka shows the cult members the bullets that ride jangling in the palms of his hands, then he flicks the bullets off his fingers and hits the cult members, knocking them down.</p>

<p>「He’s shooting bullets with his hands.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka shotgun.」</p>

<p>「We don’t need guns anymore.」</p>

<p>「The defeat of modern weapons.」</p>

<p>「If Gun-kun can be defeated by Shachiken, he must be happy.」</p>

<p>　Most of the cultists were killed by the Tanaka shotgun, but their leader was still standing, as if he had been lucky to hit the right spot.</p>

<p>　Although he had already almost won the battle, he could not leave the girls on the battlefield. As Tanaka wonders what to do, Rin came running up to him.</p>

<p>“Sensei.”</p>

<p>“Rin, Can you take this girl to safety?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>　Tanaka gently peels off the girl who is hugging him and says to her as he looks at her.</p>

<p>“I’m very proud of you. Can you take shelter with that sister of yours?”</p>

<p>　Tanaka said, and the girl nodded and went to Rin.</p>

<p>　After watching them leave the battlefield, Tanaka went to the leader, who still had some fight left in him.</p>

<p>“You, you treacherous people who don’t know anything about the labyrinth, …… will eventually receive your damnation. ……!”</p>

<p>“I know more about dungeons than you do. It’s not as noble as you think.”</p>

<p>“What did you say ……?　You mock the labyrinth!”</p>

<p>　The cult members were angry at being denied what they worshiped.</p>

<p>　But Tanaka also knew a lot about dungeons. He did not say this without thinking.</p>

<p>“Dungeons are not only bad, but they also enrich people in the form of resources. But the essence of dungeons is ‘malice. They are not gods.”</p>

<p>　This was Tanaka’s conclusion after years of diving in dungeons.</p>

<p>　The reason they are able to extract valuable resources is to lure explorers into the dungeon. Tanaka thought that dungeons were like insectivorous plants.</p>

<p>“That’s not true……!　The labyrinth is our savior nanoda……!”</p>

<p>　Tanaka’s words were not acceptable to the dungeon-worshipping cultists. If what they believed was wrong, they would be nothing more than criminals, and they could not admit such a thing.</p>

<p>　The cultist secretly gripped the dagger hidden in his back and suddenly attacked Tanaka.</p>

<p>“Release the labyrinth!”</p>

<p>　The dagger was aimed at Tanaka’s neck.</p>

<p>　But Tanaka lightly snatches the dagger with one hand and strikes the cultist in the face with his right fist.</p>

<p>　The bone of his nose was broken and his face caved in with a “Mekki” sound. As Tanaka swung his fist, the cultist was blown away and bounced several times on the ground before collapsing.</p>

<p>　As Tanaka looks at him, he mutters one last time:</p>

<p>“You’re not much to talk about, are you?”</p>
