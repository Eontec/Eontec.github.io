<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　After a pleasant meal, I had a light collaboration meeting with Hoshino and decided to leave. <br />
　I was also told that I could stay the night, but I felt it was too early to do so. I didn’t want to get too cozy and make it hard to leave.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Oh, you’re leaving, Shachiken?　Let’s play Marika!” <br />
“I’ll miss …….”</p>

<p>　I regretted my choice to leave a little when Ryota and Akari-chan saddened me, but this place is close enough that I can always come back to see them. I promised to come back and visit them again and managed to convince them.</p>

<p>” I look forward to our collaboration.” <br />
“Thank you very much for coming all the way here today. I’m going to learn more about cooking so that next time I can make something even better.” <br />
“I’m looking forward to it. Call me anytime.”</p>

<p>　After talking with Hoshino like that, Sumi-san came near me. <br />
　Sumi-san said to me in a voice just loud enough for the others not to hear.</p>

<p>“Yui has brightened up so much thanks to you, Tanaka-san, thank you very much. She has been forcing herself to act cheerful since her father died, but now she can laugh heartily like she used to.” <br />
“No, I didn’t really do anything”</p>

<p>　It’s true that I helped her when she were attacked by monsters, but that’s about it. <br />
　After that, Hoshino got back on her own. It was not my power</p>

<p>“Fufu so humble. Please take good care of her from now on. Both of you and her mother are…… “</p>

<p>　Saying that, Junsuke-san squeezed my hand gently. <br />
　What did she do to me?　I was surprised by the suddenness of the situation.</p>

<p>“I was just joking. Just kidding.” <br />
“Ha ha ……”</p>

<p>　Was it really a joke? <br />
　This is a demonic woman, …… too difficult an enemy for me with my limited experience in love.</p>

<p>“Hey mom!　How long are you two talking to each other?” <br />
“Okay, okay, I’m coming back”</p>

<p>　Sumi left with that. <br />
　I was sent off by the four people waving their hands forever at the entrance, and I went home.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>　Three days after visiting the Hoshino family. <br />
　I had come to Nishi-Tokyo again by train.</p>

<p>　I was looking for “Hachioji Dungeon”, which is one of the largest dungeons in West Tokyo. <br />
　It is famous for its strong monsters, and many people have died in this dungeon in the past. It is said that deep class monsters appeared in the lower levels at that time. <br />
　That is why it is now forbidden to enter the lower levels.   <br />
　Well, it didn’t matter though, because we planned to deliver this time to the middle layer.</p>

<p>“Ah!　Tanaka-san!　Good morning!”</p>

<p>　I was called as I approached the dungeon. <br />
　The voice was, of course, Hoshino. She was dressed in her usual exploration clothes and carried a large sword on her back. She looked like she was ready to go.</p>

<p>“Good morning. Nice to see you today.” <br />
“Yes, I’m glad to meet you!　I’m looking forward to working with you!　I’ll do my best!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino was more enthusiastic than usual. <br />
　When I first met her, she didn’t have that many subscribers, but now she’s a big-name D-tuber with over a million subscribers.
　And yet, she was still delivering her videos frequently and changing her stories as hard as she can. I was bowled over by her hard work.</p>

<p>“I’ll start streaming as soon as I can. Are you okay?” <br />
“Yes!　Anytime is fine!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s permission was granted, so I launched the drone. <br />
　Hoshino was the guest this time, so she was going to be streaming on my channel. Of course, we’ll split the proceeds fifty-fifty. I offered to give her the full amount, but she declined.</p>

<p>“All right, this is set up OK …….let’s start the delivery.”</p>

<p>　The drone lit a red light to indicate the start of the feed. <br />
　I was the first one on the screen. The viewers didn’t know that Hoshino was the guest.</p>

<p>“Good morning, viewers. Thank you for coming to our delivery this morning.”</p>

<p>「Wakotsu.” <br />
「Wako.」 <br />
「Wako Kensei.」 <br />
「I’ve been waiting for you.」 <br />
「Tanaka!　Thank you for the broadcast!」 <br />
「What kind of monster are you going to eat today?」</p>

<p>　In no time at all, the number of contacts exceeded 100,000. I still can’t get used to this speed……. <br />
　Are that many people really watching?</p>

<p>“Come on, Riri, say hi to them too.” <br />
“Ri?”</p>

<p>　With a tap on my pocket, Riri came out from inside and bowed her head “Ri” to the drone. She then sliped back into her pocket, probably sleepy. <br />
　Well, it’s a good thing she said hello.</p>

<p>「Riri-chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!」 <br />
「I’m so glad you’re doing well today, Riri!」 <br />
「You just saw me!」 <br />
「You look so cute and sleepy」 <br />
「I want to lick it!」
「I want to sleep in Shachiken’s pocket, too.」 <br />
「Is the handshake session still on ？？？？?」 <br />
「She’s so cute and soft ……」 <br />
「Disgusting lol!」<br />
「Riri would be sleeping in my pocket.」</p>

<p>　When Riri appears, the momentum of the comments accelerated. <br />
　She is as popular as ever. I’m afraid that if I created a Lili channel, I’d lose subscribers.</p>

<p>“Well, today I’m going to invite a guest to join me to deliver the stream. So here we go!”</p>

<p>　I call out, and Hoshino came up next to me with a smile. <br />
　She looked a little nervous. I wonder if it’s because we haven’t done much collaboration work together.</p>

<p>“Oh, good morning! I’m Yui Hoshino from Yui Channel!　Nice to meet you!”</p>

<p>　At the last word, Hoshino bites her teeth as hard as she can. <br />
　Hoshino blushes in embarrassment.</p>

<p>「It’s Yui-chan!!!!」 <br />
「Yui-chan!」 <br />
「It’s been a while since the two of them were in a dungeon together, hasn’t it?」 <br />
「It’s a date delivery, isn’t it!」 <br />
「I like the two of you delivering dungeons. It seems to be stable.」 <br />
「They’re so cute and chewy.」 <br />
「You must be nervous because you’re with Shachiken (grin).」 <br />
「You’re a maiden, aren’t you?」 <br />
「Power No. 1 and Power No. 2 are going to deliver again (awe).」 <br />
「I heard you’re delivering the brains of the day.」 <br />
「Power is power」 <br />
「Just get on with it!」 <br />
「Really, come on, get married. I’m ready for the wedding spree.」</p>

<p>“I’m so happy to be collaborating with Tanaka-san today!　So today I will be apprenticed to the very strong Tanaka-san, and I’m going to have him instruct me vigorously!　I’m looking forward to working with you!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino bowed her head to me. <br />
　Yes, that is the subject of this collaboration.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was still strong enough for her young age. But Hoshino wanted to become even stronger. <br />
　That’s why she asked to be my apprentice. I don’t mind teaching others, and I’m interested to see how strong Hoshino can become. There was no reason to refuse.</p>

<p>「Sounds like an interesting project.」 <br />
「Will it make you even stronger? …… (fear).」 <br />
「I’m so excited to be able to become an apprentice to Shachiken.」 <br />
「It’s a good thing.」 <br />
「So you’re going to go from being his apprentice to being his wife?」 <br />
「That’s too clever!」</p>

<p>　The comments were also positive. <br />
　I’m sure they’ll enjoy this.</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s get right into the dungeon, shall we?” <br />
“Yes, sir!　I look forward to working with you, Tanaka-san!”</p>

<p>　And so we stepped into the Hachioji Dungeon.</p>

<p>….</p>
