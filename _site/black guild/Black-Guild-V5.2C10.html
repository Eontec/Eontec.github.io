<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Now that everything is ready, I would like to start the food stream. Thank you very much.” <br />
“Wow, I’m looking forward to it!”</p>

<p>　I greeted the camera, and Hoshino crackled and clapped her hands to enliven the scene. I’m glad she was there, because the picture would have been a little bland if it was just me.</p>

<p>「Yay!」 <br />
「Thank you for the cooking show!」 <br />
「Suddenly it’s so heartwarming.」 <br />
「Suddenly it’s so cheerful.」 <br />
<!--more-->
「You’re the only person I know who does the food stream in the dungeon stream.」 <br />
「I saw a guy copying you the other day and he threw up and went down immediately.」 <br />
「When normal people imitate him.」 <br />
「Yui-chan looks like she’s having fun, but she’s definitely going to end up eating shit.」 <br />
「Well, it’s better to know your husband’s tastes as soon as possible.」</p>

<p>　We were now in an open area of the dungeon. <br />
　There was a small lake nearby, a place where we could relax.</p>

<p>　So I pulled out a set of cooking utensils and a table from my business bag. I usually carry cooking utensils and a tent with me in case I get lost anywhere.</p>

<p>　Now that I was feeling hungry, I decided to start cooking.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san, did you bring any ingredients?” <br />
“No?　Of course we will eat what we can find in the dungeon.”</p>

<p>　I said that and put the big tongue out on the table!　 <br />
　Hoshino, seeing it still wiggling, let out a cute scream.</p>

<p>“This is …….” <br />
“Ah, it’s Mimic’s tongue tongue. It’s been a long time since I’ve had one.” <br />
“Haha…… come to think of it, you took this……”</p>

<p>「I knew that.」 <br />
「It’s gross.」 <br />
「Oh, my God!」 <br />
「Oh, my God!」 <br />
「You’ll be cursed if you eat it.」 <br />
「It’s still moving lol. It’s still alive.」</p>

<p>　Mimic tongue was not well received. <br />
　It’s a rare ingredient that is not easy to get.</p>

<p>　If you are not familiar with demon cuisine, it may seem grotesque, but no animal on earth has such a big tongue. <br />
　Anyway, I decided to cook it.</p>

<p>“Mimics are A-rank monsters. They contain a large amount of magic. As you may know, ingesting more than the allowable amount of magic element can cause poisoning symptoms. I’m fine, but it might be hard on Hoshino’s body.” <br />
“Eh, then I don’t have to eat it …….” <br />
“I’ll reduce the amount of magic element by preparing it properly, so don’t worry.” <br />
“Ah, yes. Thank you…”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s expression darkened as she said it. <br />
　What happened?</p>

<p>「You’re blatantly shocked, lol」 <br />
「You’ve been raised and dropped so nicely.」 <br />
「But it got turned around!」 <br />
「You’ve got to give it up.」 <br />
「You’ve got to learn from experience.」 <br />
「But what do you do to prepare it?」 <br />
「Didn’t we use some kind of weird mushrooms to drain the magical element before?」 <br />
「But he didn’t pick any of those mushrooms during this delivery.」 <br />
「Whatever it is, I’m looking forward to it.」</p>

<p>“So what’s the first thing you’re going to do?” <br />
“First, we’re going to drain the blood out of them. The blood of demons contains a lot of magical elements. If you drain it, the amount of magic elements will be reduced considerably.”</p>

<p>　I quickly dismantled the tongue of the mimic, drained the blood and washed it well with the water I had brought with me. I could have used water from a nearby lake, but that kind of water could have been mimicked by slime, so I’m not going to do that today. <br />
　Some slimes are nasty parasitic types. My stomach acid can dissolve them, but I don’t know about Hoshino.</p>

<p>「You’re so used to it, lol.」 <br />
「It looks like regular meat when you take it apart.」 <br />
「Looks pretty tasty.」 <br />
「It sure does.」 <br />
「I’m getting hungry.」 <br />
「You guys are losing your senses, aren’t you?」</p>

<p>“I’m going to boil them in the water I’ve already brought to a boil next. It’s okay if it’s half done. This will dilute the magical element even more. If you do this, the magical element will be diluted enough for even Hoshino to eat.” <br />
“I see. ……”</p>

<p>　While receiving Hoshino’s assistance, I prepared the tongue tongue. <br />
　After tongue tongue, next was Rocket Bull meat. This is a B-rank monster, so all you have to do is drain the blood and wash it with water. I’ll bake it at the end, so the magic essence will come out at that time.</p>

<p>“Riri, riri.”</p>

<p>　Riri came out of my breast pocket as I worked. <br />
　Then she jumped over to the table and moved her body as if demanding something.</p>

<p>「Riri-tan is here!　It’s a win!」 <br />
「A big hit!」 <br />
「I love it!」 <br />
「Fumuguru fumuguruii! (excited, horrified string of words)」 <br />
「The mystery man is happy.」</p>

<p>“Are you hungry?　Just give me a minute.”</p>

<p>　I said and handed Lili a piece of rocket bull meat. <br />
　Then she opened her mouth and swallowed it whole.</p>

<p>“Riri~♡♡”</p>

<p>　Riri shook her body happily. <br />
　Satisfied, she lied down on the table and begins to watch me as she wiggles around.</p>

<p>「Ha ha ha Riri-tan, you’re so cute, Riri-tan.」 <br />
「What a sexy pose ……!」 <br />
「You are too service minded.」 <br />
「That’s a little too sexual. ……!　I’m going to have you arrested for sexual misconduct.」 <br />
「There are a lot of Hentai gentlemen on this site.」 <br />
「Ririi is cute, but the viewers are too creepy.」</p>

<p>　While Riri was quiet, I proceeded to work on the meat in one go. <br />
　I finished cutting up the meat, and finally cut up the mushrooms and vegetables I picked up in the dungeon and arranged them on a platter.    <br />
　This BBQ of dungeon ingredients looked like a feast.</p>

<p>「This looks delicious.」 <br />
「No, you can’t tell these are from the dungeon.」 <br />
「Oh no, I want to have a BBQ.」 <br />
「Where can I eat it?」 <br />
「I’m going to go into the dungeon first.」 <br />
「I don’t know, it’s impossible to start with.」 <br />
「This is going to be a hit at the dungeon food specialty restaurant ……!」 <br />
「Only a limited number of people can eat it. ……」 <br />
「But this is that mimic, right?　Can you really eat it?」</p>
