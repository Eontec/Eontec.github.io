<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Okay, then, let’s get to grilling.”</p>

<p>　I put the grill on a stone platform and lit it on fire. <br />
　When you BBQ, there will be soot and grease, but the dungeon has a self-cleaning system, so even if it gets a little dirty, it will be clean in a while. So it was okay to do this.</p>

<p>“……Yeah, it’s getting to be a nice fire.”</p>

<p>　While I was happily making the fire, Hoshino was peeking at me with interest.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Did you also prepare that wood you’re burning?” <br />
“Oh, that?　No, no, no. This is something I got in the dungeon.” <br />
“What?　Did you cut down any trees?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino tilted her head. <br />
　It seems she didn’t realize that I had taken it.</p>

<p>“That’s not quite right either. This is a Treant.” <br />
“I see……. eh!　You’re using Trent as firewood?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino rolled her eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>　Treants are monsters in the shape of trees. <br />
　No, it would be more correct to say that it is a tree turned into a monster as it is, rather than just having the shape of a tree.    <br />
　It has a face on its trunk, moves by moving its roots like legs, and attacks by swinging its branches.</p>

<p>　It looks not so scary and is slow, so it is easy to escape, but if it catches you, it will suck your life force until you die.</p>

<p>　It is not uncommon to find yourself surrounded by treants while moving through the forest …….</p>

<p>　Treants are mostly the same as plants, so even if you kill them, the woody part of the treant remains. The trunk part is dry and makes good firewood.</p>

<p>“Remember that one time you got tangled up with a treant while we were moving around?” <br />
“Come to think of it, it might have been ……. I didn’t remember it at the time because Mr. Tanaka took him down in an instant.”</p>

<p>「I certainly didn’t remember it either.」 <br />
「He took down quite a few different ones.」 <br />
「Treants make good firewood. I learned something new.」 <br />
「I’m sure you could really use that knowledge if you’re an explorer.」 <br />
「Fire is its weakness, so it makes sense that it burns well.」 <br />
「Treant: “Burn my corpse.”」 <br />
「Oh man, that’s cool ……」 <br />
「Is it as cool as it sounds?」 <br />
「I bet Treant didn’t expect to be used as firewood either.」</p>

<p>“In addition to food, there are many other things you can pick up in the dungeon that you can use. Especially for those explorers who don’t have a bag with dimensional extensions, it is better to be able to procure things locally. It is an essential skill if you want to go below the lower levels.” <br />
“I understand!　I’ll study!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino took out a notebook and wrote down my words. <br />
　It’s nostalgic, I used to write down what my mentor told me too.</p>

<p>「Well, but there are almost no explorers who go below the lower level …….」 <br />
「Even if they do go, it’s more than one person, so the baggage problem is going to be relatively easy to solve.」 <br />
「But then, if you stray, you’ll die instantly.」 <br />
「Shachiken was sent to the depths alone, so he would have died without this skill set.」 <br />
「I think this story should be spread more widely because getting lost in dungeons is a totally common occurrence.」 <br />
「Indeed. There are a lot of explorers out there who starve to death.」</p>

<p>“Now that the fire is lit, it’s time to start grilling. Let’s follow the custom of roasting meat and start with the tongue first.” <br />
“Yes…….”</p>

<p>「Mimic tongue.」 <br />
「Yui-chan, you look so cute all of a sudden.」 <br />
「It looks delicious, but ……」 <br />
「I’m getting hungry.」</p>

<p>　As I placed the mimic tongue tongue on the net, I could smell the good smell. <br />
　Mimic’s tongue is full of flavor and still tender. It is fatty and has a different taste than beef tongue.</p>

<p>“Here, you can eat it.”</p>

<p>　I sprinkled some salt from the dungeon on the medium grilled tongue, put it on a plate, and handed it to Hoshino. (TL: Turned out it was medium) <br />
　Hoshino accepted it with some hesitation.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>　She lifted it up with her chopsticks and slowly put it in her mouth. <br />
　She had eaten in the dungeon before, but there was no meat. I guess she still had some resistance to eating monsters.</p>

<p>　But that would end today.</p>

<p>“…… Eh!　Oh, it’s delicious!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s eyes lit up as soon as she put the mimic tongue in her mouth. <br />
　Huh, you fell for it. ・・・・</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” <br />
“Hah, yes. The texture is good, but every time I chew it, the flavor spreads in my mouth,…… I’ve never eaten anything like this before.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said in surprise. <br />
　Monster meat has a unique flavor. <br />
　This is my guess, but I think the magic element combines with the meat component to give it a unique flavor. And it suits the taste buds of the awakened who are resistant to magical elements. <br />
　The higher the rank of the monster, the stronger the flavor. The Mimic is an A-rank monster, so it has a strong flavor.</p>

<p>“That’s good to know. There’s plenty more where that came from.” <br />
“Let’s see………, then, just a litttle more………”</p>

<p>　She’s a precious demon-eating friend. <br />
　I’ll feed her until her belly is ripped open and drag her into the swamp. (Tl: basically saying he’ll get her hooked on it, he coupld have probably phrased it better)</p>

<p>　I’ve always wanted to have someone to share this taste with. No mercy. (Tl: Seems the phrasing was on purpose)</p>

<p>「They’re eating so much grass.」 <br />
「Wow …… I’ve been fed …….」 <br />
「Seriously, it tastes good?」 <br />
「I’m so hungry …… I’m going to yakiniku today.」 <br />
「I’m there now.」 <br />
「I just got here, what are they eating? (English)」 <br />
「He’s eating a mimic. That’s funny.」 <br />
「Mimic!　Are you kidding me?　What part of it do you eat? (English)」 <br />
「Even the gaijin nikis are surprised.」 <br />
「『#DungeonMeals  』 and 『#MimicMeals 』 are trending …….」</p>

<p>“Look, the rocket bull is cooked too. This one is sweet with lots of fat.” <br />
“Oh, thank you. Whew, whew. Mooooo …… mmmm!　This one is delicious too ♡♡”(Tl: Get you a man that can cook)</p>

<p>　Hoshino, completely hooked on dungeon food, put the grilled meat in her stomach with a bang. Her initial reservations had completely disappeared. <br />
　The strategy was complete.</p>

<p>「She eats so much!」 <br />
「Girls who eat a lot are cute.」 <br />
「Shachiken with a bad face lol.」 <br />
「You’ve got my stomach.」 <br />
「No, No!!」 <br />
「Why is Tanaka the one who grabs the food?……」 <br />
「Yum!」 <br />
「Let’s open a restaurant specializing in dungeon food. I’ll open a restaurant that specializes in dungeon food, and I’ll have Riri on the back menu.」 <br />
「Ha ha ha, I want to be eaten by Riri-tan…….」 <br />
「Ia… fungurui… (a hideous string of characters that seems to match)」 <br />
「Oh, Riri-tan is eating too. So cute.」 <br />
「Seriously, if we’re good at this, we could save the food crisis.」</p>

<p>　After that we continued to enjoy our meal, and we were all exhausted. <br />
　Next time, I’ll ask Hoshino to try something a little more sophisticated. I’m looking forward to it now.</p>

<p>….</p>
