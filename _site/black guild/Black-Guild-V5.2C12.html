<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Hah~ I’m so full~♡”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said with satisfaction as she finished her meal. <br />
　In the end, we finished off all of the mimic tongue and rocket bull meat.</p>

<p>　It must have been quite a lot, but there were two …… no, three foodies here. It was gone in less than an hour.</p>

<p>“Are you full too, Riri?” <br />
“Riri!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Riri, who had eaten so much that she was as round as a balloon, replied cheerfully. <br />
　She was rolling around, looking so cute. She tried to stand up a few times, but her short legs were not enough to support her round body, and each time she fell down.    <br />
　Then she gave up and started to roll over and play.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we should take a short break and then go home. Is there anything else you want to do?” <br />
“No, I’m fine to go home too. ……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said that, and as if she had noticed something, she went through her belongings. <br />
　Then take out a 1.8 liter bottle. Looking at the label, it looks like Japanese sake.</p>

<p>“Aah…… I forgot to put this…….” <br />
“What’s that?” <br />
“My father liked to drink, so I thought I’d put some sake in front of the cenotaph. I feel like my dad’s grave is on the ground, but his …… soul is here. Besides, I thought it would please the other people who died here.” <br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>　Because of its location in a dungeon, few bereaved families are able to come to the cenotaph. <br />
　It is a natural feeling to want to do all you can to help. I don’t know if there is such a thing as a soul, but Hoshino’s father would be pleased.</p>

<p>“Then let’s get going.” <br />
“Oh, I’ll be fine on my own!　I’ll be right back, so you go rest, Tanaka-san!”</p>

<p>　I was about to get up, but Hoshino stopped me. <br />
　It’s not far from here to the cenotaph, and I’ve defeated all the monsters, so I’m safe is safe,…….</p>

<p>“But……” <br />
“I can’t have Tanaka-san tagging along with my carelessness!　I’ll be right back, so please wait for me.” <br />
“Okay, okay. I’ll be waiting for you.”</p>

<p>　I gave in to Hoshino’s push and decided to withdraw. <br />
　Hoshino is surprisingly stubborn.</p>

<p>“I’m going to go now!　You wait for me, Riri-chan.”</p>

<p>　When Hoshino says this to Riri, Riri shouts a menacing, “Sha!”. <br />
　Since the last time I put her on my lap at Hoshino’s house, she has become hostile toward Hoshino. I don’t think there’s any need to be jealous of her, since it’s like I’m holding her in my arms all the time, but I don’t understand the pet mind.</p>

<p>“You be careful.” <br />
“Yes!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino ran off with the sake in her arms. <br />
　I watched her back.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>　A few minutes after parting ways with Tanaka, Hoshino, carrying a bottle of sake, was back at the memorial service.</p>

<p>“Fu, I’m here. I’m sorry I kept coming back.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino bowed to the cenotaph and placed a bottle of sake in front of it.</p>

<p>“This is your father’s favorite drink, isn’t it?　I asked my mom. She also said to say hi to you, father. Ah, and of course, Ryota and Akari too. They both wanted to meet you, father.”</p>

<p>　In front of the cenotaph, Hoshino spoke her mind. <br />
　When she came here earlier, it was on stream and Tanaka was watching. But now there was no one there. The words she had been keeping in her heart came out of her mouth.</p>

<p>“I know you’re probably worried that my mother and I are a little out of shape, but don’t worry, we’re all doing fine. Ryota and Akari are also solid. So, don’t worry, Dad.”</p>

<p>　Wiping away a single tear, Hoshino turned her back to the cenotaph.</p>

<p>　
　Now, I have to hurry back to Tanaka-san. <br />
　Just as she thought so,……, a metallic “clang” sound rang out on the spot.</p>

<p>“……What?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino hurriedly looked around. <br />
　The dungeon was not strange. There were no people or monsters.</p>

<p>　Where in the world was the sound coming from?　With impatience on her face and her nerves on edge, she heard a loud “clang!” A sound like metal on metal was heard.</p>

<p>“Na…… no way!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino realized what the sound was. <br />
　It was coming from the metal door on the side of the cenotaph.</p>

<p>“Uu, no way. …….”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s expression turned to despair. <br />
　That solid door that blocked the path to the lower level was made to seal a certain monster to the lower level.</p>

<p>　The door was struck from behind by something and began to distort. <br />
　The metal lock and bolt can opener attached to the door were trying their best to hold out, but they were broken by the overwhelming physical strength of the other side. <br />
　A huge axe-like blade could be seen through a gap in the door, and a pair of glowing red eyes peeked out from the gap.</p>

<p>　The terrifyingly glowing eyes were staring straight at …… Hoshino.(Tl: What an unlucky day to break free)</p>

<p>“No, no…….”</p>

<p>“I have to get out of the way and call for help”, she thought.</p>

<p>　Even knowing that, Hoshino’s legs didn’t move.</p>

<p>　Bewilderment, surprise, and fear. Those emotions jumbled together in her body, dulling her thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>『 Gaaaaaahhhh! 』</p>

<p>　With a terrifying roar, the door was breached. <br />
　Then, from behind the door, the creature emerged.</p>

<p>　Its body was much larger than that of an ordinary minotaur, and its muscles swelled to the point of ripping the skin. <br />
　Its body was covered in scars, showing at a glance how many deathbattles the monster had endured.</p>

<p>　On his back are the weapons he had taken from the explorers he killed, and in his hand he held a large, ominous-looking axe that befitted his massive frame.</p>

<p>　His head was covered with a magnificent horn, but one of the horns was broken off and missing. <br />
　The wound was the only bitter reminder of defeat for the monster. Even now, the missing horn still ached, and every time it did so, the brain remembered its anger.</p>

<p>　The Abnormally grown minotaur. <br />
　Bamo craft of one horn.</p>

<p>　The rank set for the monster by the government is “SS”. <br />
　It is strong enough to destroy a city by itself.</p>

<p>『 Oooooooooooooooo! 』</p>

<p>　The bamocraft roars with rage and joy. <br />
　Revenge. The time for revenge has come.(Tl: At this point I just feel pity for the guy)</p>

<p>　Even now, she vividly recall it; her enemy. <br />
　The same smelling individual was right in front of her.</p>

<p>　With a wicked smile on his ugly face, Bamocraft approached Hoshino.</p>

<p>　He wouldn’t let this end easily. <br />
　The anger that had been piling up. He would make it known to this individual.</p>
