<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　Bamocraft had not appeared in public before. <br />
　And the fact that he showed up just as Hoshino was left alone. These two things were no coincidence.</p>

<p>　Having once been wounded by someone of a lower rank than himself, Bamocraft was ashamed of his own weakness. <br />
　In order not to be defeated again, he continued to grow stronger by fighting, defeating, and devouring powerful monsters in the lower and deeper levels of the dungeon.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Normally, monsters do not fight each other in dungeons. <br />
　This is because monsters born in dungeons have a “loose sense of camaraderice” with each other.</p>

<p>　This is not to say that monsters do not sometimes turn on each other in territorial disputes. However, such incidents are rare, and even monsters of different species basically live together without taking each other’s territory.</p>

<p>　However, abnormal grown individuals often do not have that “loose sense of camaraderie”. They are separated from the rule and discipline of the dungeon. <br />
　Therefore, they become larger and stronger than normal individuals by attacking other monsters without mercy.</p>

<p>　In addition to their muscular strength, the Bamocraft also had an unusually developed sense of smell. <br />
　The bamocraft, which were in the deeper layers, could smell Hoshino’s scent when she came to the middle layer.</p>

<p>　Sensing the similarity between the smell of Hoshino and that of his enemy, he had come to the middle layer. However, the mysterious presence next to Hoshino had frightened him, and he had not approached her until now.</p>

<p>　He had become so strong that there was no way he could be defeated by a human. He was proud of this, but he still followed the warning of his instincts and hid his breath until now.</p>

<p>　But that presence was gone now. <br />
　There is only a weak human being who smells like the enemy.</p>

<p>　Now was the time for revenge. <br />
　Kicking the ground with all his might, Bamocraft approached Hoshino with a speed that bears no resemblance to his hulking frame, and swung the axe in his hand.</p>

<p>『 Bwwooooooooooooo!!!! 』 <br />
“……Tsu!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s reaction was delayed for a moment, but she managed to leap to the side and avoid the blow. <br />
　The axe hit the ground and tore through the hard ground as easily as butter. Even though Hoshino had a sturdy body, it would be impossible for her to retain her original shape if she were to take a hit.</p>

<p>(……No. I don’t think I can win. I have to run away.)</p>

<p>　The opponent was an SS-ranked monster. <br />
　Hoshino had come to be able to win against A-ranked monsters, but SS-ranked monsters were a different level. She had no vision of winning at all.</p>

<p>　Hoshino tried to go back the way she came. <br />
　Then, Bamocraft quickly caught up with her and swung his axe again.</p>

<p>“Kya!</p>

<p>　The well-aimed blow passed just above Hoshino’s head and sliced off several strands of her hair. If it had been just a few centimeters lower, it would have been fatal.</p>

<p>“Ha, this is too fast…… I can’t run away from this……!”</p>

<p>　Not only was she losing in power, she was also losing speed. <br />
　If she turn your back next time, she would surely be cut in half from her back.</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s expression showed impatience, wondering how she could get out of this situation.</p>

<p>『Ga, Gagagaga!』</p>

<p>　Seeing Hoshino’s frightened face as she held her sword at the ready, Bamocraft laughed at her in a funny way. Then, he quickly put his hand behind his back at one of the many weapons he is carrying, and pulled out a sword.</p>

<p>　It was an ordinary two-handed sword with no special features. <br />
　It looks like it had been used for a long time, and there were some fine scratches on the blade.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was puzzled, wondering what on earth he was trying to do. <br />
　But the next moment, Hoshino remembered what the sword is.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s …… my father’s …… sword!”</p>

<p>　The sword had been used by her father, Tsuyoshi Hoshino. <br />
　The body was found, but the sword had certainly not been discovered until now. It was thought that the sword might have been broken during the battle, but that was not the case.</p>

<p>　The sword had been carried on the back of the Bamocraft all this time.</p>

<p>　Hoshino now realized that Bamokraft was aware of her father’s relationship with her. And at the same time, she also understood that he had no intention of letting her off the hook.</p>

<p>『Bu, fufu.』</p>

<p>　With an ugly smile on his face, Bamokraft pinched the tip of the sword in his hand. <br />
　The next moment, he snapped the sword right in front of …… Hoshino’s eyes!　He turned it and showed her.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was stunned by the suddenness of the event. <br />
　She felt as if her memories of her father were shattered along with the sword. A single tear spilled from her eye.</p>

<p>　Seeing this, Bamo Craft laughed happily, 『 Bahahahahahaha! 』 <br />
　Hoshino was knocked down to the bottom of disappointment. She was stunned for a while, but then something hot started to rise up in her chest.</p>

<p>“I won’t …… let it go.” <br />
『 Buch?』 <br />
“Only you …… I won’t forgive you!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino howled through her tears. <br />
　She felt a rage she had never felt before, a rage that was stronger than she had ever felt in her entire life.</p>

<p>　Her whole body heated up and her cells activated. <br />
　Gripping the great sword tightly in both hands, she slashed at the bamocraft.</p>

<p>“Haaaaaaah!”</p>

<p>　With all her strength, she swung the great sword. <br />
　Bamocraft caught her attack with the hilt of the axe she held in her hand. Then,</p>

<p>『 Bwooo!』</p>

<p>　A strong shock hit his hand holding the axe, and his huge body fell back. <br />
　The sheer strength of her body was beyond imagination, and a look of impatience came over Bamocraft’s face.</p>

<p>“I will not run anymore!　I will avenge my father’s death here!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino declared and boldly challenged her opponent, who was far superior to her.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Tl Note: Sorry for the unplanned break, I was feeling out of it. Exams are closer and stuff, so I had to adjust my schedule, I’m good now. Surprisingly, only two new chapters are out, so I’ve translated them. I guess it’s time for the second novel</p>
