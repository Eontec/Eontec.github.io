<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Thank you……. I’m fine now.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino, who had been leaning against me for a while, said that and moved away from me. <br />
　She was still tired, but she was able to stand firmly on her own two feet. I think with this she’ll be able to walk home.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san always helps me out when I’m in a pinch, don’t you? After all, Tanaka-san is my hero, thank you so much!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Hoshino bowed her head saying so. <br />
　It’s weird that I’m being called a hero, but I don’t feel bad about it. Every boy dreams of being a hero at least once in his life.</p>

<p>“Now then, the path to the lower layer has been opened, so let’s go home. But first…….”</p>

<p>　I collected the remaining horn of the Bamocraft and a few of the fallen weapons as trophies. If these weapons belonged to the deceased explorer, they should be given to their families. <br />
　It seems that the meat is also edible, but it is indeed uncomfortable to eat subhuman monsters. It would be unethical.    <br />
　If it was a quadruped, I would have eaten it without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Ah, wait a minute.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said and picked up a sword that had fallen to the ground. <br />
　The sword had a shattered blade and was no longer able to serve as a sword.</p>

<p>“…… This is the sword my father used to use. It can no longer be used as a weapon, but it is one of my father’s most precious possessions.” <br />
“Well, you should probably take it home with you then. …… hmm?”</p>

<p>　I noticed something and spoke out. <br />
　The sword that Hoshino held was broken at the hilt, and the cavity inside was slightly visible. <br />
　The hollow was filled with something that looked like paper. What is this?</p>

<p>“Hoshino, it looks like there is something inside the hilt.” <br />
“…… Oh, that’s right. What is it?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino touched the handle curiously. <br />
　The head of the handle turned and opened to allow you to take out what’s inside. A gimmicked weapon is a rarity. What did he put in here?</p>

<p>“This is …….”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s eyes widen in surprise as she pulls out a piece of frayed paper from the handle. <br />
　Looking at it to see what was wrong, she saw that it was not just a piece of paper, but a photograph.</p>

<p>　 The photo showed a younger Hoshino, Ryota, and Light, and a man who looked like Hoshino’s father and Sumi-san. <br />
　The place seemed to be in front of the house. Everyone was smiling and seemed happy.</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s father was fighting with this in his hands until the end.</p>

<p>“Dad……!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s voice trembled as she held her mouth with her hand. <br />
　I patted her on the back and said.</p>

<p>“Dungeon hunting is a lonely business. Hoshino and her family were his emotional …… support.”</p>

<p>　I didn’t have that. That’s why I got depressed. <br />
　I’m so envious that he has such a great support system. If I had something like that, I wouldn’t be suffering.</p>

<p>“Ugh, ugh ……, father……!”</p>

<p>　Tears were falling down on the picture. <br />
　I turned the drone’s camera toward the day after tomorrow and continued patting Hoshino on the back until she calmed down.</p>

<p>“Thank you, ……. I’m fine now.”</p>

<p>　After sniffling, Hoshino said again the line I heard a while ago. <br />
　The tears seem to have subsided, though she was still red around the eyes.</p>

<p>“I was scared when I met that monster, but …… I’m glad I came here today. I’m glad that I was able to avenge him, but I’m also glad that I was able to recognize how much my father cared about my family. I’m sure my family will be very happy.” <br />
“Yeah, I’m sure they will.”</p>

<p>　I agreed with Hoshino, who gave me a bright smile. <br />
　I was a little worried that her heart might be inclined in a negative direction after meeting her family’s enemy, but it seems that my fears were unfounded. <br />
　On the contrary, Hoshino had become even stronger. Physically and mentally. If I’m not careful, she might end up stronger than me. I might as well work out a little.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go home now. Can you walk by yourself?” <br />
“Yes!　I’m fine!”</p>

<p>　With Hoshino reassuringly saying that, I continued onward and upward in the dungeon. <br />
　Thanks to the fact that we were able to defeat the enemies along the way, we rarely encountered any monsters.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll be able to return home soon.” <br />
“I guess so. We will be on the ground in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>　We returned to the entrance of the dungeon in less than an hour. <br />
　We felt relaxed. But then we had an encounter that blew away our relaxed mood.</p>

<p>”—-You’re early, Makoto.” <br />
“What?”</p>

<p>　My name was called out of the blue, and I let out a dumbfounded voice. <br />
　That person showed up in front of us with her long black hair swaying.</p>

<p>　I, as well as Hoshino, who was walking next to me, recognized the person and said, “Ah”.</p>

<p>“I’d like to thank you first of all for your hard work. I’m glad you made it back in one piece.”</p>

<p>　The person, Kanade Amatsuki, who is also my childhood friend and the chief of the Subjugation Division, said this with a smile on her fair face.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Tl Note: Our main heroine finally appears. Sorry for the delay in posting, Power went down in the area. I’ll post the nekxt and latest Chapter for this novel, and maybe 2 or 3 for the other one</p>
