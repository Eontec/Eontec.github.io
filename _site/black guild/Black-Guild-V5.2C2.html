<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　The Hachioji dungeon was large and rich in nature. <br />
　The ground was covered with grass and many trees. This kind of dungeon is rare because most dungeons, like caves, have very little grass and trees.</p>

<p>　Some dungeons are filled with water or are made entirely of glass.</p>

<p>“…… here we are!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　With a rustle, a nearby bush moved and a gray wolf appeared.  <br />
　It is the gray wolf, a monster that appears in the upper levels of the dungeon. <br />
　It is a monster with no particular abilities, a little stronger than the wolves on the ground, and only a dungeon novice would have a hard time with it.</p>

<p>“Can I do it?”  <br />
“Yes, of course!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino asked, stepping forward with a confident look on her face. <br />
　She pulled out the great sword on her back and held it proudly in the air.</p>

<p>『 Grrrr …… 』</p>

<p>　The total number of Gray Wolves was seven. <br />
　They seemed to be hungry, and slowly approached Hoshino as if peeking at her with drool dripping down their faces.</p>

<p>「Oh my God, that’s scary.」 <br />
「Even the monsters in the upper levels are usually scary.」 <br />
「Even the Gray Wolf is hard enough to repel a pistol.」 <br />
「I knew that Awakened are monsters.」 <br />
「 It’s drooling all over lol.」 <br />
「I can’t help it, Yui-chan looks so delicious.」 <br />
「I’m calling the cops.」</p>

<p>　After observing Hoshino for a while, the grey wolves ran out and attacked her at once. <br />
　It seems they thought they could beat her head-on. Well, Hoshino looks like an impotent, pretty girl to the casual observer.</p>

<p>　However, her thin arms are filled with tremendous strength. If I train her, I think she will eventually surpass me.</p>

<p>“Eiiii!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino raised her sword and slammed it into the ground. <br />
　With a roar, the ground was gouged out and a tremendous shockwave was released in front of her.</p>

<p>『 Caw! ?』</p>

<p>　The Gray Wolves, hit by the shockwave at close range, let out a high-pitched cry and fell over. <br />
　The bodies of the monsters in the dungeon disappear, leaving only the fangs of the gray wolves. The bodies of monsters in the dungeon are made of magical elements, and when they are defeated, the bonds of magical elements weaken and the corpses disappear. <br />
　The parts of the body where the bond of magical elements is strong differ from monster to monster, but generally, parts such as fangs and horns will remain. <br />
　For stronger monsters in the deeper levels, the whole body may remain, but for monsters in the lower levels and above, most of the body will disappear.</p>

<p>“I did it! Tanaka-san!” <br />
“Yeah, that was a good attack.”</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s moves were getting better every time we met. <br />
　She must be practicing on a regular basis. She’s working hard to support her family.</p>

<p>「The ground is so bumpy and dented, lol.」 <br />
「Gray Wolf-kun, you got me with one hit. ……」 <br />
「One hit, seven kills!」 <br />
「I’m so proud of you!」 <br />
「I can’t wait to see baby number three.」 <br />
「This is a nineteen year old, is that right?　She’s got the strength of an ordinary A rank or above.」 <br />
「The future of the Japanese explorer world is bright.」 <br />
「Just having Shachiken here is shiny, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like the enemies in the upper levels are going to be that much of a training ground anymore. Let’s head for the middle level quickly.” <br />
“Yes, Got it!”</p>

<p>　We ran down the dungeon at a brisk pace. <br />
　The monsters in the upper levels were too scared to attack us, probably because we had been so aggressive with the Gray Wolves. <br />
　Thanks to that, we soon reached the middle level.</p>

<p>“…… hmm?”</p>

<p>　As I was running, I spotted something when I reached the middle level and stopped. <br />
　Hoshino, who was running next to me, also noticed it and stopped.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” <br />
“No, I found something good.” <br />
“A good thing?”</p>

<p>　Hoshino tilted her head. <br />
　I took her with me and moved to the wall of the dungeon. <br />
　A wooden treasure chest appeared, hidden in a tree. The edge of this one, hidden in the tree, happened to be out of the corner of my eye and I find it.</p>

<p>「Oh!　It’s a treasure chest!」 <br />
「I wonder what’s in it?」 <br />
「That’s one of the best parts of exploring a dungeon, isn’t it?」 <br />
「I mean, how can you find a treasure chest when you’re running that fast……?」
「The answer is because it’s Shachiken.」 <br />
「You didn’t know?　You can’t escape Tanaka’s eyes…….」 <br />
「Tanaka’s eyes are clairvoyant.」 <br />
「I’m afraid he’s going to say he can see through walls.」</p>

<p>　Everyone was saying something in the comments, but I’m not going to go into it. <br />
　Everyone says whatever they want. It’s annoying to be told that I can do things I’ve never done before on the Internet. <br />
　I watched my slow commentary video the other day, where they explained that I can run on water. <br />
　I didn’t do that in the video though……. hah</p>

<p>　No, I can do that, but please don’t tell me I can do it when I haven’t done it.</p>
