<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Amatsukii-san……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino muttered. <br />
　From the way Amatsuki spoke, it seems she was acquainted with Hoshino’s father. <br />
　Well, that is also true. The First Division is always on the lookout for talented people. I’m sure they have all the information on excellent explorers. Maybe they’ve scouted him before.</p>

<p>　But it’s unusual for Amatsuki to praise someone so much.
<!--more-->
　Hoshino’s fight must have stuck in Amatsuki’s mind that much. When she gets praised, it makes me, as a master, turn up my nose at her.</p>

<p>“Also, thank you for being friends with Rin. She doesn’t have many friends, so I hope you’ll continue to get along with her.” <br />
“I’m the one who is indebted to Rin!　So it’s all right!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino was a little flustered. <br />
　The mood is friendly. The last time the two met, the atmosphere was nasty, so I was worried, but this seems to be okay.</p>

<p>　That’s what I thought……</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s right. Rin-chan reminded me of something I had to do.”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Hoshino came closer to me. <br />
　I was so close that our skin was almost touching, and I was taking my time to observe Hoshino’s face, thinking about how long her eyelashes were. <br />
　Hoshino’s face was slightly reddish and she looked a little nervous.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” <br />
“My mother told me. I have to show it properly. That’s why I’m going to be brave like Rin-chan.”</p>

<p>　What are you talking about? The moment I was about to ask, Hoshino put her arm around my neck and pulled me towards her. And the next moment… Hoshino’s lips were on mine.</p>

<p>”—-!!!?!?”</p>

<p>　The suddenness of the situation confused me. <br />
　I was about to push Hoshino out of the way, but I almost stopped my hand from going out because it would have been dangerous. <br />
　As a result, I simply accepted Hoshino’s kiss without saying a word.</p>

<p>「Holy shit━━━━!」 <br />
「You did it, Yui-chan!」 <br />
「Shachiken’s hands are so fuzzy!」 <br />
「Hold me!」 <br />
「Chief Amatsuki is stunned.」 <br />
「I’d be surprised if he suddenly kissed her in front of me…」 <br />
「Well, the heroine race is heating up, isn’t it?」 <br />
「I haven’t given up on the harem route yet!」 <br />
「What?　Is there a route where everyone can be happy from here?」 <br />
「The kiss was so long, Yui must have had a lot of time on her hands.」 <br />
「I’m too jealous!　I want to do it with Shachiken too!」 <br />
「Is it that way ……?」 <br />
「This is normal!」</p>

<p>　This is the third time I’ve been kissed, but honestly I’m not used to it at all. <br />
　It’s soft and smells so good …… that my brain goes numb and I can’t move. I can handle being poisoned by any monster, but I can’t tolerate this one.</p>

<p>　Hoshino was doing so while hugging me, but eventually she slowly let go of my body. Hoshino seemed to be very nervous and even her ears were red. <br />
　She’s so cute. I’ve been trying not to think of her as a woman, but if she does this to me, I can’t do it anymore. I couldn’t help but look at her that way.</p>

<p>“I’m like Amatsuki-san and Rin-chan. I’m not an old acquaintance like Amagatsu-san and Rin-chan, but I can’t lose the …… feeling that I love Tanaka-san!　So, um, …… excuse me!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said and ran away to the exit of the dungeon. <br />
I tried to chase after her, but my shoulder was grabbed from behind.</p>

<p>“…… Makoto, what is this?” <br />
“Hiii”</p>

<p>　Slowly looking back, there was the figure of Amatsuki, clad in a terrifying fighting spirit. <br />
　The gentle atmosphere that had existed earlier was no longer there.</p>

<p>“What are you doing hooking up with a young girl again?” <br />
“I’m sorry!　I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>　I didn’t mean to do anything wrong, but I couldn’t help but apologize. <br />
　I was so afraid that I was going to be lectured until morning, so I took advantage of the opportunity and ran away.</p>

<p>“Hey, Makoto, where are you going?” <br />
“I’m sorry!　See you next time!”</p>

<p>　I jumped out of the dungeon, snapping off the delivery. <br />
　Ahh… a lot happened today.</p>

<p>“I can’t just run away fom them forever……”</p>

<p>　It would be disloyal to the girls to be slouching. <br />
　I went on my way home, wondering what to do.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Tl Note: I’m back people!!! Had to go on a break to study for some exams that just started, and coming back, there’s only like 3 chapters here to catch up, so I’ll catch up here today and start with Silver Castle tommorow</p>
