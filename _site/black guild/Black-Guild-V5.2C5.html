<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　After fighting off the mimic, we proceeded further into the dungeon.</p>

<p>　This area is now completely in the middle of the dungeon. The deeper you go in a dungeon, the less nature there is, but this place is as rich in nature as ever. Maybe that’s why there are so many animal-type monsters.</p>

<p>“I wish there were cow monsters or something, so I could make delicious food.” <br />
“If it’s cows, I love them too!　The yakiniku I had with Tanaka-san was delicious……” <br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Hoshino looked ecstatic as she said this. <br />
　It’s a far cry from when I told her about Mimic’s tongue. Poor thing, let’s cook it up deliciously and give it a try.</p>

<p>「I can eat a cow-shaped monster, you know.」 <br />
「Well, if it’s dungeon food, I’ve eaten it with Shachiken before.」 <br />
「To be honest, I’d like to eat dungeon food too.」 <br />
「I’m afraid that if you don’t have a tolerance to magical elements, you’ll get intoxicated in an instant.」 <br />
「In the first place, there’s no such thing on the market, most of the monsters will lose their meat after they’re killed.」 <br />
「Hey, Yui-chan, didn’t you say you went to yakiniku with Tanaka?　I didn’t hear anything about it!」 <br />
「Aww, you leaked it, didn’t you?」 <br />
「How could anything happen between a young man and a young woman at a yakiniku ……?」 <br />
「Well, wait a minute, it’s not time to panic yet, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba…」 <br />
「You calm down.」 <br />
「Damn!　I wish I could grill the meat that Shachiken eats!」 <br />
「You guys have a very unique way of being jealous.」</p>

<p>　Hoshino’s comment got the commenters excited again. <br />
　Adachi was there at the time, and nothing like that happened……. Well, let’s not make excuses for it, because it will only add fuel to the fire. Silence is more precious than gold.</p>

<p>　As we were walking along, two monsters appeared in front of us.</p>

<p>『 Burrrrrrrrr! 』 <br />
『  Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ……  』</p>

<p>　They were cows with two sharply pointed horns.(Tl: What an unlucky day to be shaped like a cow) <br />
　But besides their horns, the cows had another characteristic that made them different from ordinary cows.</p>

<p>　They have a propulsion thruster on their backs. <br />
　The device, made of a material similar to horns, emitted a low “wu-wu-wu-wun” sound.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san. That bull is ……” <br />
“That’s a ‘rocket bull. That’s unusual.”</p>

<p>　As the name suggests, the rocket bull is a bull-shaped monster that rushes forward at the speed of a rocket. <br />
　It accelerates by releasing magic essence from the propulsion thrusters attached to its back. Its speed is quite fast among the monsters that appear in the middle tier.</p>

<p>　Fortunately, its ability to move horizontally is not high, so if you run away in a zigzag direction, you can escape easily. <br />
　However, if you are in a hurry, you can often only run in a straight line, and sometimes explorers are killed when they are rushed from behind.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time since I ate rocket bull. It’s so fatty and tasty.”</p>

<p>「He’s already eaten it lol.」 <br />
「I’m sure you’ve eaten everything edible in the dungeon.」 <br />
「He’s eating all the inedible stuff in the dungeon.」 <br />
「Well, the shoggoths are definitely inedible.」 <br />
「But I’m afraid that when I watch Shachiken’s delivery, it looks so delicious.」 <br />
「Please publish that kind of book already, I’ll buy it.」 <br />
「I thought it was going to be a training episode, but it turned out to be a dinner episode.」 <br />
「I’m starving.」</p>

<p>　The rocket bull seemed to think we were the enemy and pointed its horns at us menacingly.(They are not enemies they are predetors, contemplating medium well or well done) <br />
　The sound of its propulsion thrusters grew louder and louder. It could come charging at us at any moment.</p>

<p>“What should we do? I’ve never fought one before.” <br />
“Then I’ll set an example first. Hoshino, you take the second one.” <br />
“I understand!　I’ll do my best!”</p>

<p>　He took a step forward and faced Rocketbull. <br />
　The Rocketbull made a loud 『  BURRRRR』 Then kicked the ground. <br />
　At the same time, it spurt out magical elements from its propulsion thrusters and accelerated rapidly. Its speed was just like a rocket. <br />
　I catch that high-speed blow from the …… front with a “hmph.”</p>

<p>“Okay, I’ve got him.” <br />
『 Bumo ！？』</p>

<p>　The rocket bull let out a bewildered squeal at the sudden occurrence. <br />
　It tried to break free by repeatedly spewing magical element from its propulsion thrusters, but I’m holding it tightly by the horns, so I can’t shake it off.</p>

<p>「I knew it.」 <br />
「Why are you stopping the rocket like that?」 <br />
「I didn’t see you at all. …… I noticed you stopped the rocket.」 <br />
「Usually the strategy is to go around to the side and attack from the flank…….」 <br />
「If you can stop it from the front, it’s faster to stop it from the front (brains).」 <br />
「Power is power.」 <br />
「Ya. ！！！！」 <br />
「This is where Tanaka comes in.」 <br />
「Power ！！！！！！」</p>

<p>　I held the horns and lifted my arms, bending my back as far as I could.</p>

<p>“Ho!” <br />
『 Momo mooo ！？』(Tl: It turned into a normal cow lol)</p>

<p>　Rocketbull’s body was lifted vertically. <br />
　I continued to bend backwards and slam Rocketbull’s back into the ground behind me as hard as I can.</p>

<p>　With a bang, the rocketbull’s back is slammed to the ground behind me and dies. <br />
　The body was returned to its magical element, leaving behind several kilograms of …… fatty flesh. The flesh that is strong enough to withstand the rocket’s propulsion would remain even after it is defeated.</p>

<p>「Brainbuster lol」 <br />
「It’s the Tanaka Buster!」 <br />
「What a horrible move ……」 <br />
「Don’t do wrestling moves on a monster lol」 <br />
「This is real life wrestling.」 <br />
「The wrestling organization should surround Shachiken.」 <br />
「It can attract a lot of customers, but I don’t want to deal with him…….」 <br />
「I’m not sure I can take it easy on you, Tanaka.」 <br />
「No, you can’t go easy on him, you’ll just end up dead.」</p>
