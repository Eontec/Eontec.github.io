<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“…… and it goes something like this. Get me the other one, please.”</p>

<p>　I said to Hoshino as I retrieved the rocket bull’s material. <br />
　The other rocket bull is upset that his friends were killed, but he still seems willing to fight. Rocket bulls are feisty monsters and will not run away.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Ha, yes!　I’ll do my best. ……!”</p>

<p>「Come to think of it, it was just a sample, wasn’t it?」 <br />
「Yui-chan is motivated, but it’s impossible for now, isn’t it?」 <br />
「Tanaka, show us a better example!」 <br />
「Yui-chan is going for it!」 <br />
「Don’t push yourself too hard, Yui!」 <br />
「You’re just so motivated, that’s all that matters.」</p>

<p>　Hoshino sat back and held her hands loosely out in front of her. <br />
　Her stance resembled that of a wrestler. It is a suitable stance for catching a rushing opponent.</p>

<p>　She probably didn’t think about it, but her body moved naturally. Hoshino has talent, just as I suspected. If she could learn to fight with her head, she would be much stronger.</p>

<p>『Burrrrrrrr …… Burrrrr! 』</p>

<p>　The rocket bull took aim at Hoshino and kicked the ground. <br />
　Then, it accelerated rapidly, spurting out a burst of magical elements from the propulsion thrusters that sprouted from its back.</p>

<p>　It is so fast that from the front it feels as if it has gone to warp. An ordinary explorer would have been pierced by its two horns without being able to react.</p>

<p>　But Hoshino had it firmly in her sights.</p>

<p>“……EEEEEEEE!”</p>

<p>　Just before the rush hit, Hoshino also kicked the ground and hit the rocket bull. <br />
　She firmly slid her body between the horns and held the horns in place with both sides. This way, there is no need to worry about getting stabbed.</p>

<p>“MU, GIGI……”</p>

<p>　Hoshino was catching the rocket bull’s rush. <br />
　『 Bumo ……! 』Rocketbull was incredulous. The girl who is smaller than himself caught him, of course he would be surprised.</p>

<p>「What?」 <br />
「Seriously?」 <br />
「What?」 <br />
「She caught it.」 <br />
「How could you do that?」 <br />
「That’s the disciple.」 <br />
「She inherited his muscle brain gene.」 <br />
「What’s that power in your thin arms?」 <br />
「Power!」 <br />
「Ya ！！！！！」 <br />
「Hoshino Kinni-chan.」 <br />
「Muscle Chan II.」(Tl: Kinni is a japanese male bodybuilder) <br />
「The nicknames are becoming less and less cute…….」</p>

<p>『 Bumo! 』</p>

<p>　The rocket bull blasted more magical energy from its propulsion thrusters and tried to blow Hoshino away. <br />
　Then Hoshino, who was catching the rocket bull, began to back away slowly. It looks like it’s hard.</p>

<p>“Hoshino, you need to sit back more. Keep your center of gravity low and transfer the force from the bottom to the top.” <br />
“I understand. ……Guni ni ……”</p>

<p>　I went right next to Hoshino, who was taking it, and gave her some advice. <br />
　Rocketbull looked at me and gave me a surprised look, but didn’t stop the momentum of the propulsion thrusters.</p>

<p>「I usually go to you for advice, lol.」 <br />
「Why can’t you get in there?」 <br />
「Rocketbull: “what the hell is this guy?”」 <br />
「Oh no, the picture is too surreal.」</p>

<p>　Hoshino, just as I had taught her, lowered her posture even more and changed the way she put her strength into it. <br />
　Then, Hoshino’s legs, which had been jittering, stopped. Okay, it looks like she’s doing exactly what I taught her.</p>

<p>“Drive your foot into the ground like a stake, “and catch it not only with your body, but also with the power of the ground. And if you can catch it completely, use the opponent’s strength to throw. The way you throw should be whatever is easy for your body to move.” <br />
“I understand……, I got it!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino, with a serious expression on her face, held the corner of the rocket bull. <br />
　The next moment, Hoshino’s body, which had been wobbling until now, suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>　This was a sign that she had completely absorbed the power. It seems that she has grasped how to use her power.</p>

<p>“Here ……!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino removed her left hand from the corner and rotated her body halfway to the side. <br />
　She then placed the corner she had been holding with her right hand on her shoulder and, putting all her strength into her legs, she leaned forward as hard as she could.</p>

<p>“Eeeeee!” <br />
『 Bumo! 』</p>

<p>　Hoshino used the rocket bull’s horns to do a one arm shoulder throw. <br />
　Seeing its own body in the air, the rocket bull squealed in surprise before being slammed …… to the ground with all its might.</p>

<p>　Rocketbull’s back hit the ground hard with a loud bang. <br />
　The blow seems to have been fatal, and the rocket bull disappeared, leaving behind a large piece of flesh, just as it did before.</p>

<p>　Yes, it was a good blow. No complaints.</p>

<p>「Eeeee!」 <br />
「well done lol」 <br />
「You can do it, ！！！！！」 <br />
「I’m tired of this muscle-brained couple」 <br />
「Yui is only 19 years old, right?　Oh my god ……」 <br />
「I’ve been watching the streaming for a while now and I can see the difference in the way she moves now compared to before she met Shachiken.」 <br />
「You already have the ability to rank A. If you work hard, it won’t be too late for you to become an S rank.」 <br />
「That’s an S in growth potential!」 <br />
「I’m also curious about Tanaka’s status.」 <br />
「Destructive power SSS, speed SS, range A, Engurance SS, Agility SSS, growth potential SS, something like this?」 <br />
「Too much of a monster. Nerf it.」 <br />
「I think he’ll be able to stop time soon.」</p>

<p>　The comments were lively as Hoshino defeated it. <br />
　It’s worth it for me to teach her. It’s fun to watch people grow.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did it!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino, who had confirmed that the rocket bull had disappeared, hugged me happily. <br />
　She was as happy as a big dog. But unlike a dog, soft things hit me in various ways. I tried my best to stifle my thoughts and just patted her on the head.</p>

<p>“You did good. It was perfect.” <br />
“Thanks to you, Tanaka.-san”</p>

<p>　Saying that, Hoshino gives me a dazzling smile at close range. <br />
　Ugh, too dazzling for a coporate slave.</p>

<p>「It’s working, lol.」 <br />
「Too cute.」 <br />
「Yui-chan you’ve become even cuter than before.」 <br />
「Love makes a girl grow up, you know.」 <br />
「Hurry up and get married!」 <br />
「If you push her a little more, she’ll be fine.」 <br />
「I’m a Rin-chan fan, I’m crying.」 <br />
「What, Tanaka will make us all happy.」 <br />
「I’m a heretic, I’m longing for Dojima’s route.」 <br />
「That’s probably not implemented. ……」 <br />
「If it’s the friendship end, there’s a chance.」</p>
