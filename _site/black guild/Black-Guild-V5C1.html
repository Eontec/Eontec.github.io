<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“The camera is good. The angle of view is …… okay. I’m a little nervous because this is the first time I’ve ever streamed inside my house.”</p>

<p>　One day around noon. I was about to start streaming at home.</p>

<p>　My house is a small 1K rental.</p>

<p>　I cleaned up the house before I started streaming, but I couldn’t get rid of the feeling of a man living alone. It was a little embarrassing to stream in a place like this, but Adachi said it would be more popular than renting a studio, so I had no choice but to accept the idea.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　I fixed the drone that I usually fly on a tripod and put my upper body on the floor and a small table in front of it in the angle of view.</p>

<p>“Okay, let’s start the delivery.”</p>

<p>　I operate my phone and start streaming.</p>

<p>　Then all at once, the number of viewers increased, and in less than a minute, we had 10,000 people.</p>

<p>「Wakotsu!」</p>

<p>「Here comes the delivery!」</p>

<p>「Shachiken strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」</p>

<p>「Thank you for the sudden delivery.」</p>

<p>「 Are you in a dungeon?」</p>

<p>「Could it be a home stream?」</p>

<p>「Thank God for home streaming. I was just out of it.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Thanks for the delivery!/;</p>

<p>「Today’s delivery says 【『 Home Delivery 』Tanaka introduces his pet 】, but is it for real?」</p>

<p>「I thought you were going to keep me!」</p>

<p>「What happened to your promise to keep me?」</p>

<p>「There’s a bunch of pets in here lol.」</p>

<p>「What are you going to keep?　I don’t think I can take care of a dog, maybe a hamster?」</p>

<p>「I’m amazed that he’s trying to win over the animal-loving crowd.」</p>

<p>「Why is he wearing a business suit at home?」</p>

<p>　The comments kept pouring in.</p>

<p>　Meanwhile, the number of viewers exceeded 500,000, and the number was growing rapidly. The number of subscribers increased, so the initial growth is totally different.</p>

<p>　I can’t believe that so many people gathered at the home of such a dull guy. You never know what will happen in life.</p>

<p>“Hello everyone. My name is Makoto Tanaka. Thank you for coming today.”</p>

<p>「Hello!」</p>

<p>「Hello.」</p>

<p>「You’re as formal as ever,lol.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　relax!」</p>

<p>“As the title says, today I would like to introduce my new pet. It’s a bit of a rare breed, so I might surprise you.”</p>

<p>「Eh, what is it?」</p>

<p>「Being surprised by a pet is indeed an exaggeration, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「What is it, a Komodo dragon?」</p>

<p>「Maybe it’s an elephant.」</p>

<p>「It’s not going in the room, is it?」</p>

<p>「Maybe they’d be surprised if he got a viewer.」</p>

<p>「Then you should keep me! (exasperated)」</p>

<p>「Today, too, the squeals of the people who are in love are very energetic.」</p>

<p>　When the comments had warmed up, I put my hand in my breast pocket.</p>

<p>　Then I grab that guy in there and put him on the table.</p>

<p>「Hmm?」</p>

<p>「Huh?」</p>

<p>「What’s this?」</p>

<p>「Is it a black caterpillar?」</p>

<p>「No, there’s no such thing.」</p>

<p>「It looks like slime.」</p>

<p>「What? Monster?」</p>

<p>「Maybe this kid is from …….」</p>

<p>“This is Shoggoth, the newest member of our family. Come on, say hello.”</p>

<p>“Riri!”</p>

<p>　Shogos raises a short hand in a cheerful voice toward the drone as he urges her to greet him. Apparently, he understands the language quite well.</p>

<p>「Sho, Shoggoth-tan!」</p>

<p>「You’re alive!」</p>

<p>「That’s impossible!　Is he saying he’s going to keep Shoggoth! (English)」</p>

<p>「No, I didn’t expect this, wow!」</p>

<p>「What? (exclaiming in delight)」</p>

<p>「Why do you think the monsters are so friendly to people (awe)?」</p>

<p>「Because he’s Shachiken, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「Shoggoths who used to be objects of fear are now mascots…….」</p>

<p>「Yea!　Ia!　(unintelligible language)」</p>

<p>「Holy shit, Shoggoth-tan’s a kita ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！ 」</p>

<p>「I love this guy, I love him so much.」</p>

<p>「Shogath-tan’s screencaps are spreading on SNS so fast. I’m sure he’s already an idol.」</p>

<p>　I was a little worried, but it seems that Shoggoth was accepted by everyone. If they become so well known, government extremists won’t be able to start exterminating them badly.</p>

<p>　Public opinion is on our side.</p>

<p>“Good job on saying hello.”</p>

<p>“Riri……♡”</p>

<p>　When I patted him on the back while praising him, Shoggoth let out a sweet voice.</p>

<p>　The way it looks, it doesn’t look very much like a monster.</p>

<p>「Ka, you’re too cute …….」</p>

<p>「She’s completely turned into a moe character, lol.」</p>

<p>「Is there any chance of her becoming a human and becoming a heroine yet?」</p>

<p>「The heroine race is about to intensify again.」</p>

<p>「Too much of a big hole in the race!」</p>

<p>「When are you going to shake Shogoth-tan’s hand ！！？！？？！？！？？」</p>

<p>「I love it, I want to be stroked by Shachiken too.」</p>

<p>「I want to be praised by Tanaka and be kissed by him too!」</p>

<p>「I’m glad you guys aren’t wavering.」</p>

<p>…..
Tl Note: My journey got delayed, but I managed to use a friend’s laptop for this chapter, maybe there’ll be one tommorow, more likely on Saturday(That’s when it was rescheduled to)</p>
