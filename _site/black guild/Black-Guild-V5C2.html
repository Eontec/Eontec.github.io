<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Tekeri?”</p>

<p>　Shoggoth seemed to be curious about the drone and got close to it, staring closely into the lens.</p>

<p>　Naturally, the viewers were excited to see Shogos’ image filling the delivery screen.</p>

<p>「Holy shit, it’s over here ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！」 
<!--more--> <br />
「Shogotan, look at me!」</p>

<p>「Gawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!」</p>

<p>「Ha, ha, Shogotan kawaii yo ……!」</p>

<p>「My heart is starting to get a little excited.」</p>

<p>「I’ve already seen illustrations of anthropomorphic Shogotan on social networking sites.」</p>

<p>「She’ll be a brown downer yandere bishoujo when she becomes a person!」</p>

<p>「I’m too happy with my sexuality. More of this.」</p>

<p>「Sure, she’s cute, but isn’t it scary that there’s a …… monster in town?」</p>

<p>「What are you, anti-monsters?」</p>

<p>「There’s no guarantee that they won’t attack people, so I can understand why you’re scared.」</p>

<p>「There’s no way Shogotan would attack people!　You’ve got to be kidding me ！！１１１」</p>

<p>　The comments were starting to get kind of rough.</p>

<p>　The cause was a comment from someone who was afraid of monsters.</p>

<p>　This person had a valid point. If they were kept in a facility somewhere, I would be worried, but if they were kept by an ordinary person like me, I would be worried too.</p>

<p>　Naturally, I discussed this with Dojima-san.</p>

<p>“It is natural that you are worried. Shoggoths are monsters, and there is no guarantee that they will never attack people. But I will not let that happen. If he tries to attack anyone, even a little, I will cut him down. I promised that to Dojima-san as well, and he gave me permission to keep them.”</p>

<p>　I said, stroking Shoggoth’s back with my index finger.</p>

<p>　Even without such a promise, Dojima-san gave me permission to keep him, but this is my way of apologizing. It pains me to cut down this guy who is so compassionate, but I can’t keep a monster with half a mind.</p>

<p>「It’s safe, then, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「You’re so ready for this.」</p>

<p>「I guess it’s safer for Tanaka to keep an eye on him than to lock him up.」</p>

<p>「Well, well, if that’s the case with someone as powerful as you, ……」</p>

<p>「You’re so sweet when they talk about cutting you down, you’re so cute.」</p>

<p>「Well, I can understand your fear, but there is no such thing as a friendly monster in the world, and it would be a shame to get rid of a valuable research subject.」</p>

<p>「That’s right. I think the whole world is planning to kidnap Shogotan right now.」</p>

<p>「If it wasn’t for Tanaka’s side, I’m sure she’d be kidnapped in a heartbeat.」</p>

<p>　Phew, the comments have calmed down somehow.</p>

<p>　This should be fine as long as Shoggoth doesn’t cause any problems. Fortunately, Shoggoth is smart and listens to me. I don’t think they’ll attack anyone else.</p>

<p>「By the way, doesn’t Shogotan have a name?　No, Shogotan would be fine, but Tanaka wouldn’t call me that.」</p>

<p>「Sure, I want a name.」</p>

<p>「I’d like a cute name.」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Pick a name!」</p>

<p>　…… name, huh? I certainly hadn’t thought about it.</p>

<p>　It is better to have a name in order to get along well with others. But I’m not good at thinking of such things.</p>

<p>　I think desperately with my head.</p>

<p>“Ummm……… Shogosuke, Shogozura?</p>

<p>“Teke…….”</p>

<p>「Too bad you have no naming sense.」</p>

<p>「Shogosuke lmao.」</p>

<p>「Shogotan is so confused.」</p>

<p>「Your naming sense is worse than Shoggoth!」</p>

<p>「Sorry, he’s a muscle gorilla. He’s not good with that kind of thing.」</p>

<p>「Shachien is too cute!」</p>

<p>「Tanaka!　Shogokura is really not it!」</p>

<p>　The criticism was thunderous.</p>

<p>　I was aware that I had no sense of style, but I was depressed when I was told so much. ……</p>

<p>　There is an option to ask for a name from the audience, but the name is a living thing and I want to give it to myself.</p>

<p>　For the moment, I’ve learned that “shogo + kanji” is lame, so let’s think of another pattern. I’ll think of something else, like the way it looks or …… the sound it makes. Let’s get inspiration from such things.</p>

<p>“If I take it from its appearance, I’ll go with 『 Kuro 』?　It’s not a bad name, but it sounds a bit dog-like. 『  Chibi  』 because of its small size…… would also be too easy. It could grow up to be big. If I were to take 『   Teke 』 from its squeak, would I call it 『    Teke  』?　No, it’s hard to call it that. If we take it from another pattern, maybe 『     Riri   』?”</p>

<p>“Riri!”</p>

<p>　Shoggoth’s voice comes out in response to the last name candidate I mentioned.</p>

<p>　Apparently she likes this one.</p>

<p>「Riri, huh, that’s nice.」</p>

<p>「Finally, we’ve got a good one.」</p>

<p>「I’m going to go make a Riri-chan fan club.」</p>

<p>「Fugurui!　Riri! Riri!　Riri! (language my brain refuses to understand)」</p>

<p>「I love it!」</p>

<p>「Are you selling Riri-chan merchandise yet? (Gobbling).」</p>

<p>　The viewers’ reactions were also favorable.</p>

<p>　I’m glad I managed to come up with a satisfactory name. I feel like I’ve done a great job.</p>

<p>　While I’m looking tired like that, Riri shred her own tail and offers it to me. It seemed that she was showing her appreciation for my efforts.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“Riri!”</p>

<p>　I eat a piece of Lili’s tail with a flip of my hand.</p>

<p>　The first time I ate it, it was crunchy, but now it’s much smoother.</p>

<p>「Yes!　You’re eating it?」</p>

<p>「She’s offering it to him lol.」</p>

<p>「She’s too devoted!」</p>

<p>「They say Shoggoths are a serving race, but …… you’re serving too much.」</p>

<p>「She’s happy to see herself being eaten.」</p>

<p>「Grabbing his stomach (physical) (inside).」</p>

<p>「She’s just like ampanman in the way she expresses her love.」(Tl: Anime character with a bean bun(anpan) for his head that feeds injured people part of his head, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpanman">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>「Why is Shachiken eating normally too (dumbfounded)?」</p>

<p>「A self-cutting heroine, huh, ……, that’s new.」</p>

<p>「Eek.」</p>

<p>「It’s really bad. It’s so perfect for my sexuality.」</p>

<p>「I want to eat Riri, hahaha…」</p>

<p>「It’s going to melt your stomach.」</p>

<p>「You guys are so good together.」</p>

<p>「Why am I getting so many great clips at a home delivery?」</p>

<p>　When I ate the Riri, the viewers got a big kick out of it.</p>

<p>　It’s like my senses were numbed because I eat it on a regular basis. Is it a shocking sight for normal people?</p>

<p>　Well, it’s okay, because they seem to be happy. Riri seems to have been liked by a lot of people.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s see if I can show you some of the tricks I’ve been working on. Sit down and make a move!”</p>

<p>“Riri!　Riri!”</p>

<p>“Another one!　Tentacles!”</p>

<p>“Teke!　Ri!”　</p>

<p>「Gyaaah!　Tentacles!」</p>

<p>「Tentacle heroine, huh?」</p>

<p>「Traffic jam of attributes.」</p>

<p>「Ehhhhhh!」</p>

<p>「I can’t wait to shake hands with her!」</p>

<p>　And so Riri’s delivery proceeded with great success.</p>
