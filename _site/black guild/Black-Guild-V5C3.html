<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　The pet shoggoth, Riri’s delivery was a huge success, and by the evening the number of viewers had exceeded 200 million.</p>

<p>　I was surprised that so many people came without me having to go to the dungeon.</p>

<p>　Riri power, truly amazing.
<!--more--></p>

<p>「Riri-tan is so cute, ha ha ha.」</p>

<p>「I want to be eaten by Riri-tan.」</p>

<p>「Your hands are so tiny and cute. ……」</p>

<p>「［\220000］ Here’s all the money I’ve earned this month. Please use it for Riri.」</p>

<p>「[\50000] I’d like to contribute more, but that’s enough for today……. Shit!　I hate myself for not making enough money!」</p>

<p>　Riri already had a strong following.</p>

<p>　Some people are growing with pet videos, but I guess that means she was able to capture that demographic as well.</p>

<p>　Well, Riri is no ordinary pet. ……</p>

<p>“Teke…….”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?　Hungry?”</p>

<p>“Riri!”</p>

<p>　Riri cheerfully replies to my question.</p>

<p>　It’s late in the evening and I’m hungry. I should get ready for dinner.</p>

<p>「Riri, are you hungry?」</p>

<p>「Well, she shredded her own body, so she must be short on energy, right?」</p>

<p>「So, what are you going to eat?」</p>

<p>「I think she can eat anything.」</p>

<p>「You can eat me if you want.」</p>

<p>「Riri, there are already high-fire fans」</p>

<p>「Five fan clubs were formed during the stream.」</p>

<p>「The nerd’s energy, it’s too much.」</p>

<p>　I was going to cut the delivery if I was going to make it a meal, but the viewers seem to be interested in what Riri is going to eat. I think they’d be happier if I delivered the eating scene as well.</p>

<p>　Riri didn’t seem to be stressing out about it, so I decided to keep doing it.</p>

<p>　Riri basically eats everything. She eats vegetables, fish, metal, everything, but she seems to like meat the best.</p>

<p>　I pulled out some thinly sliced pork from the fridge and brought it over to her.</p>

<p>“She has tried everything, but she seems to especially like raw meat.”</p>

<p>“Ri!　Riri!”</p>

<p>　Riri jumped and jumped greedily when she found the meat. She is like a dog.</p>

<p>“Sit down. Wait.”</p>

<p>　Riri gave me a greedy look, but did as I told her and sat down.</p>

<p>　After waiting for a while, I give her permission to go.</p>

<p>“Riri!”</p>

<p>　Riri jumped on the meat, opened her belly like a mouth, and munched on the meat. Her mouth was full of fangs.</p>

<p>　To be honest, it looks a little grotesque. It’s like the clione predation scene I’ve seen on TV before.</p>

<p>「You’re so good at listening to him, aren’t you?」</p>

<p>「She’s munching on the meat.」</p>

<p>「You’re smarter than my dog!」</p>

<p>「She has a perfect master-slave relationship with him.」</p>

<p>「Look, they’re monsters, so they’re designed to obey their stronger opponents.」</p>

<p>「Oh, I see. ……」</p>

<p>「Riri-tan is so cute and gross, hahaha.」</p>

<p>「Yea!　Ia! （Uninteligible LAnguage.)」</p>

<p>「The American military was defeated by such a cute creature?　Are you kidding me? (English)」</p>

<p>「Well, it’s not Japan that’s strong, it’s Shachiken……」</p>

<p>“Oh, and I like this one too. Shall I give you this one too?”</p>

<p>　Saying that, I take out a liquid food…… 『 Churu 』 in plastic.</p>

<p>　This food is famous as a snack for cats and dogs, but when I gave it to her, she was very receptive to it.</p>

<p>“Riri!　Riri!”</p>

<p>　When I put the chururu in front of Riri, she instantly bit it and started licking it. I knew she would love it. She eats it so deliciously that it makes me want to try it too.</p>

<p>「So Shoggoths are also crazy about Chururu? …… It’s amazing.」</p>

<p>「She’s eating it with the same tension as my cat.」</p>

<p>「The taste of chururu is the same all over the world, isn’t it?」</p>

<p>「Please publish your wish list!　I’ll send you 1,000!」</p>

<p>「［\10000］ Here is the money for the chururu. Please inspect it.」</p>

<p>「It’s starting to look delicious. …… I’ll buy one too. ……?」</p>

<p>　Riri, who had devoured all of the chururu in an instant, exhaled with a satisfied “keppu”.</p>

<p>　Her entire body was bulging out, probably because she ate it all at once.</p>

<p>“Riri, are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Riri, I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Haha, that’s great, heh?”</p>

<p>　I couldn’t believe my ears.</p>

<p>　Did you just say a word?</p>

<p>“Riri, talk to me for a second.</p>

<p>“Tanaka, suki.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s great, thanks ……, I knew you were talking!”</p>

<p>「Shabettaaaaaaaaaaaa!」</p>

<p>「Ngya wa i ii i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i!!」</p>

<p>「EEEEEEEEE!!!?!?」</p>

<p>「Really?」</p>

<p>「You’re so smart!」</p>

<p>「She’s growing up so fast.」</p>

<p>「I mean, it’s so precious when she says 『 I love you, Tanaka 』, I’m worshiping her right now in front of my screen…….」</p>

<p>「I want Tanaka to tell me he likes me too.」</p>

<p>「You guys never waver until the very end. ……」</p>

<p>…..</p>

<p>Tl Note: I’m pretty free today, maybe I’ll just catch up, I’ll probably not. I’m thinking of going out</p>
