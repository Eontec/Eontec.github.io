<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　 The day after I received an invitation from Hoshino. <br />
　I took the train to a certain station in West Tokyo.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“This is where Hoshino lives?”</p>

<p>　There were not many people in front of the station. <br />
　There was a shopping street, but it didn’t look very busy and was deserted.</p>

<p>　There is no large supermarket, and it would be a little inconvenient to live here. <br />
　But I don’t mind the quietness. Now that I’ve quit the guild, I might as well live in a place like this and take it easy.</p>

<p>“Riri?”</p>

<p>　As I’m thinking about this, Riri pops out of her pocket.
　I had told her to stay in her pocket on the train, so she had not shown her face as I had ordered. It seems she noticed that I got off the train and showed her face.</p>

<p>“That’s great, Riri. But there are still people in the train, so you’ll have to be patient a little longer. You can come out when we get to the house.”</p>

<p>　With that, I patted her head, and she saluted me with a short “Riri” and went back into my pocket. <br />
　I was worried when I decided to keep Shoggoth, but she’s a lot easier to handle than I imagined.</p>

<p>“Well, according to the address you gave me, it should be this way: …….”</p>

<p>　I walked along, looking at the map on my phone. <br />
　The occasional rice paddies and fields appeared, and children were excitedly walking off to school on the street. It was a nostalgic scene. It was hard to believe that I was in Tokyo.</p>

<p>　Incidentally, the time was 16:00(Tl: 4:00pm for the uniniciated). I came here just in time for Hoshino’s return from college. <br />
　You may wonder why I came at this hour, but according to Hoshino, it was because she wanted to treat me to dinner. <br />
　She said she didn’t think the meeting would take too long, so we’d greet Hoshino’s family, make plans for collaboration, eat dinner, and go home while there is still time for the last train. <br />
　It would be bad to stay too long.</p>

<p>“…… and here we are.”</p>

<p>　I arrived at a house that looked a little old.
　On the nameplate was written “Hoshino”. It is not a common surname, so I was sure I was in the right place.</p>

<p>“I wondered when was the last time I went into someone’s house.　The only places I’ve been to recently were my house, dungeons, and the Ministry of  Monster Control. I can’t remember the last time I went to someone’s house.”</p>

<p>　Maybe it goes back to junior high school. I realized once again that being a corporate employee is terrifying.</p>

<p>” Yo, okay.”</p>

<p>　I pressed the intercom, a little nervous. <br />
　A high pitched “ding dong” rang, and a few moments later, I heard a voice saying, “Yes”. It was probably Hoshino’s parents, so I had to be polite.</p>

<p>“I’m Makoto Tanaka, who was supposed to be here today. Pleased to meet you.” <br />
『 Ah, yes!　I’m coming out now, so please wait a moment! 』</p>

<p>　Apparently, the person on the other end of the intercom was Hoshino. <br />
　Just as I think she answered in a panic, I hear a slamming sound coming from inside the house.</p>

<p>“It’s quite clumsy, are you all right?” <br />
“Tekke?”</p>

<p>　Riri also came out of her pocket and voiced her concern. <br />
　After a few dozen seconds of waiting. The old-fashioned sliding door rattled open, and a person emerged from inside.</p>

<p>“Amazing!　It’s really Shachiken!” <br />
“Ho, hello. …….”</p>

<p>　It wasn’t Hoshino who came out, but a little boy and a girl. <br />
　The lively-looking boy was clinging to my leg and making a fuss, while the quiet-looking girl was glancing at me from a little distance. <br />
　Am I correct in assuming that these two are Hoshino’s younger brother and sister?　They both look about elementary school age. They must be quite a bit younger than me.</p>

<p>“Shachiken!　Do that one!　That 『 Shachiken TV - EVIDEO』 thing!
“That’s a different person.”</p>

<p>　As I was saying this to the boy, who seemed to be in high spirits, I heard footsteps coming from inside the house.</p>

<p>“Hey, hey!　Don’t bother Tanaka-san!”</p>

<p>　With that remark, out came Hoshino, dressed in an apron. <br />
　 Unlike her usual attire, it looked rough and fresh.</p>

<p>“I’m fine, Hoshino. I don’t mind children.”</p>

<p>　Saying that, I lifted the boy who was stuck to my leg and put him on my shoulder. <br />
　Then the boy said, “Wow!”　He’s so cute! His eyes lit up.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” <br />
“I’m Ryota!” <br />
“I see. Nice to meet you, Ryota.”</p>

<p>　Next, I talked to the girl, who was still fidgeting.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”
“Well, I’m Akari, …….”
“I see. Nice to meet you, Akari-chan.”</p>

<p>　When I said that, Akari-chan timidly grabbed my hand.
　Apparently, she’s just nervous and doesn’t seem to dislike me.</p>

<p>“Wow amazing, both of them have already become attached to you.” <br />
“I’m just opening up to them because I’m so well-known for nothing. Can I come in?” <br />
“Oh, yes!　Of course!　Please make yourself at home!” <br />
“Okay, I’m sorry to bother you.”</p>

<p>　Ryota tugged at my cheeks as I walked over to Hoshino’s house.</p>

<p>…..</p>
