<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　I entered Hoshino’s house with her younger brother and sister, Ryota and Akari-chan. <br />
　The wooden house looks a little old, and the floorboards creak and squeak as I walk around. It reminds me of my father’s parents’ house in the countryside.</p>

<p>“Shachiken!　Over here!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Ryota jumped off my shoulder and pulled my hand.</p>

<p>　He lead me inside, and something smelled good. <br />
　Hoshino was wearing an apron, which suggests that she was cooking for us. I hadn’t had a home-cooked meal in maybe 10 years. I was looking forward to it.</p>

<p>　As I arrived at the living room, I was greeted by a woman who said,</p>

<p>“Welcome, Tanaka-san. Thank you for coming.”</p>

<p>　She said in a calm voice and bowed reverently. <br />
　She was a little older than me.　She was a very beautiful woman with the appearance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_nadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a>. I was a little nervous.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. Excuse me. I am Makoto Tanaka. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, you are……” <br />
“My name is Sumi Hoshino, Yui’s mother. I look forward to working with you and my daughter. <br />
What, your mother is ……?</p>

<p>　I looked at Hoshino and Sumi alternately. <br />
　They don’t look like a mother and daughter. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the two of them were sisters.</p>

<p>　That she’s a young woman who has three …… children is amazing.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wanting to meet Ms. Tanaka for a long time. You know she talks about you all the time at home, don’t you?”
“Hey, mom!　Don’t say weird things!</p>

<p>　Hoshino shoved Sumi into the kitchen in a panic. <br />
Apparently, the relationship between parent and child is good.</p>

<p>　Even so, how are people talking about me at the Hoshino residence? I’m curious.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san!　Dinner will be ready soon, so please rest in the living room!　Ah, I’ll leave some barley tea here for you!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino said in a flustered manner and returned to the kitchen. <br />
　As I was thinking that the collaboration meeting would have to wait, Ryota pulls my hand.</p>

<p>“Hey, hey, Shachiken!　Let’s play Smash Bros!” <br />
“Oh, great. Is <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Fox_McCloud">Fox</a> still around?”</p>

<p>　Hearing the name of the game I had missed, I sat down in front of the TV with Ryota. <br />
　Full-dive type games are all the rage these days, but I prefer the old-fashioned controller-type games. When I was in junior high school, I used to play with Adachi and Suda.</p>

<p>“I’ve got all the characters!” <br />
“Wow, that’s great. Let’s go”</p>

<p>　Ryota and I sat down side by side and started playing the game. <br />
　It had been ten years since I had played a game, but my body remembered surprisingly well and I was able to play the game normally. I looked to the side while selecting a character and saw Akari standing there, fidgeting.</p>

<p>“Akari, you want to come over here?　Look, Riri’s here too.”
“Riri?”</p>

<p>　Akari’s face lit up as I pulled Riri out of my pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh my God, it’s really Riri!”　</p>

<p>　When she saw Riri, she was overjoyed and came closer to her. <br />
　Although Riri was only introduced to the public yesterday, it seems that even children already know about her. The power of the Internet to spread is amazing.</p>

<p>“Can I touch it?” <br />
“Of course. Do you mind Riri?”</p>

<p>　Riri nodded her head and said, “Teke”. She is surprisingly service-oriented. <br />
　Akari-chan sat on my lap and gently touched Riri with the palm of her hand. It was a heartwarming sight.</p>

<p>“She’s so smooth and soft!” <br />
“Riri!”</p>

<p>　Riri was proud of herself for some reason. 
　She seemed to be proud of her smoothness and softness.</p>

<p>“Shachiken, let’s go!　It’s starting!”
“Yeah, any time you want.”</p>

<p>　While I was busy with Akari, Smash Bros started. <br />
　I had memorized the controls, but my skills were slipping. I couldn’t get the combos I wanted.(Tl: The worst feeling when you go play a game you used to love)</p>

<p>“Hmmm, I could move faster in the flesh.”</p>

<p>　The character doesn’t move the way I want it to. I wish I could be a Smash Bros. character myself, but that’s not going to happen. If I tried to control it as hard as I could, I’d break the controller.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san, can I give Riri some candy?” <br />
“Of course you can. But be careful not to give her too much.”</p>

<p>　I chatted with Lily on my lap as I struggled with the game. <br />
　 I could only imagine how hard the parents of the world had to work.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Akari-chan, you should give her sweets like that. You’re good at it.” <br />
“Heh heh, Tanaka-san. You are just like our father.”(Tl: Same thing Yui said in the dungeon. Very high praise, but very heavy too)</p>

<p>　Akari-chan laughed innocently. <br />
　Yes, as I recall, Hoshino’s father had passed away. And yet these children were so cheerful, probably because of Hoshino and Junsumi’s hard work. <br />
　I know exactly how it feels to lose a parent. When I was in junior high school, both my parents were hospitalized for magical substance poisoning, and from then on I lived on my own. <br />
　I’d be happy if my presence reminds them of how it feels to have a father, even if just a little.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking these thoughts, I heard footsteps behind me.</p>

<p>“Tanaka-san, dinner is ready ……, what are you two doing!”</p>

<p>　Hoshino comes into the living room, sees us and shouts in surprise. <br />
　I was sitting next to Ryota playing a game with Akari-chan on my lap and Riri on Akari-chan’s hand. It’s a chaotic situation.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Tanaka-san. My younger siblings are bothering you…….” <br />
“No, no, it’s been a long time since we’ve played like this, so it’s fun. Hey, Ryota.” <br />
“Yes!”</p>

<p>　Ryota nodded happily. <br />
　The most important thing to remember is that you should not be afraid to ask for help,</p>

<p>“Come on, Akari, get off him. Don’t be too clingy.”
“Muu.”
“Not muu.”</p>

<p>　As they were exchanging smiles, Ryota interrupted.</p>

<p>“I understand, you’re 『 jealous 』 !　You’re jealous because you don’t get to play with Shachiken!”</p>

<p>　When Ryota teased Hoshino, Hoshino’s face turned bright red and she panicked. She flustered. <br />
　Then Akari-chan, who was listening to this, got off my lap.</p>

<p>“You wanted to ride too, didn’t you, sis? I’ve already gotten on, so it’s fine.”
“What?” (Tl: I had the exact same reaction reading that)</p>

<p>　The sister gave up her place on my lap to her sister. <br />
　I was thinking, “No, no, I’m not going to get on it even if you do that”……. Hoshino suddenly said “Eh, Ei!” and got on my lap.</p>

<p>“Hey!　Hoshino, what are you doing ……?” <br />
“Eh, ehehe. I’m sorry.” (Tl: He has been swindled. It was all planned)</p>

<p>　She apologized, but Hoshino showed no sign of getting off. <br />
　The three siblings are all such spoiled brats.</p>

<p>“I feel comfortable when I do this to Tanaka-san.”
“No, I’m glad to hear that, but it’s bad for a lot of things when you do that. ……”</p>

<p>　On top of being hit by various soft things, it smelled so good that my worldly desires were intensely stimulated.  <br />
　I’m not going to be able to do anything about it. As I was thinking that, another person came in from the kitchen.(Tl: BUSTED)</p>

<p>“What are you doing? It’s time to eat.”</p>

<p>　Sumi says in a cold voice, different from the one she used earlier. <br />
　Then Hoshino jumped up and down while saying “Hey!” Phew…it was dangerous.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about my daughter, Tanaka-san. Now, the food is ready, please come in.” <br />
“Ah, yes. Thank you. ……”</p>

<p>　I bowed my head and went to the dining table.</p>

<p>…..</p>

<p>Tl Note: I love the way the chapter just went normally at first then descended into pure chaos. That’s really just why I love this novel.</p>
