<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　Two days after the battle with Bamocraft. <br />
　I was visiting a certain facility in Shinjuku to complete a certain procedure.</p>

<p>“This place is huge……”</p>

<p>　This building, as big as the surrounding skyscrapers, is a facility of the “ Association of Explorers. <br />
　The Association of Explorers handles everything related to dungeons, including registration of explorers, rank screening, support for exploration, and redemption of materials.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　The Association of Explorers is state-run and is managed by the Association’s Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Monster Control. So any major problems that occur here must inevitably be handled by Dojima-san as well. I wonder if that guy is getting proper sleep.</p>

<p>“410, please come in.” <br />
“Ah, okay”</p>

<p>　The number on the ticket in my hand was called out, and I headed for the reception desk. <br />
　The association looks like a normal government office. I was nervous, even though I was not doing anything wrong.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for your time.” <br />
“Yes, thank you very much. I’m looking forward to working with you. Shachike-  no, Tanaka-san!”</p>

<p>　The young woman at the reception desk looked at me and let out a loud voice. <br />
　Naturally, all eyes turned to me. I quickly hid my face with my bag, but some of them might have recognized me.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry……..”</p>

<p>　The woman at the receptionist’s desk blushed with embarrassment and lowered her head. <br />
　I encourage her, “It’s okay, I don’t mind”. I know exactly how it feels to want to die after something happens at work. <br />
　But I can’t believe she was so distraught and surprised. I realized that I had become famous.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry. Well, I, Hazuki Minori Hazuki, will be in charge this time. Tanaka-sama, how can I help you today?” <br />
“Well, I heard that you get a reward for defeating named monsters.”</p>

<p>　The monster I defeated the day before yesterday was a named monster. <br />
　I have heard that the government gives a reward for defeating a named monster. When I was a company employee, I had defeated Named monsters several times, but I never received the money because it was taken by the company, of course.</p>

<p>　Because of that, I had forgotten all about the bounty, and Adachi’s message reminded me of that. <br />
　Since it was Hoshino who put the final nail in the coffin of Bamocraft, I could have given all the money to her, but she refused to do so.    <br />
　So I took the money and we split it up.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s about the bamocraft!　I was watching the delivery too!　The way you fought the SS-ranked monster tooth and nail …… is top-notch!”</p>

<p>　The receptionist, Hazuki-san, with a twinkle in her eye, operated the computer at a tremendous speed and proceeded with the procedure.    <br />
　I get a lot of compliments in comments, but it’s rare to get compliments like this in front of me, so I’m kind of embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Please wait a moment… It’s rare for a Named to be subjugated, so I’ll need a little time… here this… this… huh?”</p>

<p>　Hazuki-san tilted her head as she looked at her computer. <br />
　What is going on?</p>

<p>“I looked at Mr. Tanaka’s searcher information and saw that his searcher rank is the lowest ‘E.’ Is there a mistake at ……?” <br />
“Oh, by the way, I never updated my rank.” <br />
“What?　It is too much of a waste of time!　If you get a high rank, you can get free public transportation, free use of public facilities, and other perks!”</p>

<p>　Hazuki-san rolled her eyes and was surprised. <br />
　If you get a high explorer rank, not only do you get the perks I mentioned earlier, but you can also enter dungeons of high difficulty and gain a variety of other benefits. <br />
　But as a company employee, I had forgotten about such things. I guess Suda didn’t want me to become highly ranked, so he didn’t tell me on purpose.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, we’ll take care of that procedure here …… Yes, you’ve got enough to get an S rank with room to spare just for your most recent activities alone. …… Normally, there is a promotion exam, but with this track record, I think you can pass it. May I go over to my supervisor now and ask for a promotion?” <br />
“Really?　I would like to ask you to do so.”</p>

<p>　If they are willing to do it, there is no reason to refuse. <br />
　I asked gratefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do it!　Please leave it to me!　I’ll make my boss shake his head for sure!”</p>

<p>　With that kind of enthusiasm, Hatsuki-san calls her boss on the extension line. <br />
　After a few minutes on the phone, they quickly come to an agreement. They quickly reached an agreement.</p>

<p>“I did it!　My supervisor’s permission has been granted, so I’ll take care of that too!”</p>

<p>　Hazuki-san told me with a smile, as if he had done all he could do. <br />
　Apparently, when she called her boss to tell him that he would be bashed by the public if they knew that I was still ranked E, he quickly relented. <br />
　I heard that the approval from the Ministry of Monster Control was also granted right away. Maybe it was thanks to Dojima-san.</p>

<p>“I’m issuing an S-rank certificate now!　If you give me about 30 minutes…… I can make sure it will be ready!　So could you please wait a few minutes?” <br />
“Yes, that’s fine. I apologize for the short notice.”</p>

<p>　I bowed my head and left the reception desk. <br />
　I’m going to receive my bounty in the morning and go to the Magic Development Bureau in the afternoon.</p>

<p>　I had planned to finish my morning schedule quickly, but it looks like it’s going to take longer than I thought.</p>

<p>“I’m going to wait in the lobby with a drink or something. I’m sure it won’t take long if I’m on social networking sites.”</p>

<p>　I used to think that social networking sites were for people with free time,  but now that I’ve tried it, I find it surprisingly fun. <br />
　But now, I use it every now and then. It’s quite addictive.</p>

<p>“Hmm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>　I went to the lobby, picked out a drink at random, and headed for the nearest chair. <br />
　And then…,</p>

<p>“I was wondering who you were, but you’re not the girl from Kisaki’s place. I didn’t expect to see you here!” <br />
“What?”</p>

<p>　I turned around in surprise when my teacher’s name was mentioned. Few people know that I am Kisaki-san’s disciple. I turned my attention to the entrance of the association, wondering who in the world it was. <br />
　Suddenly, a red carpet was laid out on the floor, and a woman in a bright red dress walked briskly across the carpet. Behind her were about ten men in expensive-looking suits.</p>

<p>　This person is ……</p>

<p>“Kujoin-san?”</p>

<p>　I knew this person. <br />
　Kujouin Akane….. She’s a person who makes a lot of noise in the world.</p>

<p>　The rank is S. A well-known explorer with both ability and fame. <br />
　I’ve heard that he used to be in a party with my master and blacksmith Shiwa-san.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time. It’s good to see you looking so well.”</p>

<p>　With that, Kujoin-san coolly took off her large tinted sunglasses and made eye contact with me.</p>
