<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　I met an S-ranked explorer, Akane Kujoin-san, who appeared out of nowhere, and a few minutes later I was sitting in a chair at a coffee shop in the …… explorer’s association.</p>

<p>　Across the small square table sat Kujoin-san.
　She has fiery red hair and long eyelashes. Her face is very well-formed and her appearance is graceful. Her expensive-looking dress is so revealing that it is hard to look away. She always wears this dress like she would wear to a party, even when fighting monsters.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“I’ll have a cup of tea. Tanaka-kun, what about you?”
“Oh, I’ll have coffee.”
“Okay, little guy there, if you want something to eat, don’t hesitate to tell me.”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san said and pointed to my chest.
　Riri was peeking out of my breast pocket. She was looking around curiously at the many people around her.</p>

<p>“Can I have a cookie, please?”
“Okay. You, take care of my order.”</p>

<p>　When Kujoin-san snapped her fingers and said so, one of the ten thin machos in the back went over to the waitress and ordered. The remaining nine stood silently behind Kujoin-san and didn’t even twitch.
　They don’t look at me, but I’m very curious.</p>

<p>“When we met before, weren’t there fewer people behind you than there are now?”
“When you say before…… you mean when we fought together in the Imperial Palace dungeon?”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san says as if reminiscing about the old days.
　Kujouin-san also participated in that big battle where my master died.</p>

<p>　However, she was not in the “Underground Exploration Team” that went into the dungeon, but in the “Ground Defense Team” that protected the city from the monsters that came out of the dungeon on the ground.
　Although Ms. Kujoin excels in magical firepower to the extent that she is nicknamed the 『 Fire Empress Attack Queen 』, her mobility is apparently not that high.
　In the Imperial Palace dungeon, where monsters are constantly coming at her from all directions, it is difficult for her to make use of her strength. That is why she took on the role of fighting off the monsters on the ground.</p>

<p>　When we survived the dungeon, Kujoin-san was the first one to rush to my side and Amatsuki’s side, even though she herself was in shambles, and she was happy that we had made it back alive.
　
　And she knew then that her friend had never returned. I apologized to her for the sacrifices my master had made to save us. I wanted someone to blame me for that at that time. But,</p>

<p>“Yes. Kisaki is dead. ……. But if you made it back alive, I don’t think she regrets it. Please take good care of that life she died to protect.”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san said this gently, rather than blaming me.
　I had been expecting to be blamed, but I was ashamed of my own shallowness at that time. She was not the kind of person who would blame me for that.
　Looking back on it now, I think it may have been thanks to her that I was able to avoid a complete breakdown.</p>

<p>“I was worried about you because you looked terrible then, but …… you look good now. I’m relieved.”
‘I’m sorry for worrying you. I am fine now. This life that Master picked up for me, I won’t treat it roughly anymore.”</p>

<p>　The first time, I looked Kujouin-san straight in the eye and said.
　Then Kujoin-san smiled happily. I must be firm so as not to cause her any more worries.</p>

<p>“Even so, it’s already been seven years since the Imperial Palace disaster. It’s enough time for the number to increase”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san said as she looked at the men standing behind her.
　I couldn’t agree with that and immediately rush into it.</p>

<p>“No, normally the number of husbands ・・・・ does not increase just because seven years have passed…….”
“Oh really?”</p>

<p>　Yes, the thin macho army behind Kujoin-san are all Kujoin-san’s husbands.</p>

<p>　The gap between human beings has widened even more since the existence of the Awakened was established on earth. It is not surprising, since the Awakened are, in terms of specifications alone, a 『superior version』 of ordinary human beings.
　Their bodies were sturdy and strong, they were less susceptible to disease, and for some reason, they tended to have better looks. This has led to a widening gap in the world’s population and a significant drop in the birth rate.</p>

<p>　This is why “bigamy” is now recognized not only in Japan, but worldwide.
　Polygyny contributes to the birth rate, but if only that is allowed, there will be many problems, so polyandry is allowed at the same time.</p>

<p>　However, this polygamy system is not only for the purpose of increasing the birth rate. Rather, the government is focusing on another reason that has not been publicly announced.</p>

<p>　It is the increase in the number of awakened people.
　Children of awakened people often have the qualities to become awakened people. Especially if the children are born to two awakened people.
　Therefore, the government wants one awakened man to have multiple women and to give birth to many children. The number of awakened people is directly related to the national power.</p>

<p>　Incidentally, it is not meaningless for a female awakened person to surround herself with multiple males. It is because it is difficult for female awakened women to have children with ordinary men, so if there are many husbands, the probability of having children with them increases.</p>

<p>　However, it is obvious that the government will be bashed if it publicly announces that it wants the enlightened to have many children, so it is ostensibly said that the purpose is only to increase the birth rate.
　Well, almost everyone realizes that they want to increase the number of awakened people.</p>

<p>“So, even though the polygamy system has been allowed for so long now, you still haven’t gotten used to it?”
“No, I’ve heard a lot about two or three, but ten is indeed surprising…….”</p>

<p>　
　I glanced at the husbands behind Kujouin-san.
　They really stand tall. Their faces are somewhat proud.</p>
