<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Thank you for waiting. I brought you some tea, coffee, and cookies.”</p>

<p>　While conversing with Kujoin, the coffee shop clerk came over and placed the order on the table. <br />
　Kujoin-san said, “Thank you,” and tipped the waiter, then sipped her tea with an elegant gesture. As I recall, Kujoin-san came from a prominent family. She should have had no trouble living a normal life, so why did she become a dangerous explorer? <br />
　I suddenly wondered that.</p>

<p>“I understand that there are people who can’t accept the fact that I have so many husbands…… because I’ve been told that a lot too.”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Kujoin-san cut in with a sip of tea. <br />
　I silently listened to her words.</p>

<p>“They say things like, 『It’s not healthy to have so many husbands』, 『You should be ashamed of yourself』 and 『You don’t know what real love is』.”</p>

<p>　I’ve seen those kinds of things said several times on TV and in online articles by some celebrities I don’t know about. <br />
　Even I, who doesn’t watch much TV or anything else, have seen it, Kujoin-san. I’m sure she’s been subjected to those kinds of heartless words countless times.</p>

<p>　I grabbed a cookie and fed it to Riri in my breast pocket as I said to Kujoin-san,</p>

<p>“…… that must be hard for you.” <br />
“No, it’s not. I’m totally fine, I don’t mind at all.” <br />
“He ……?”</p>

<p>　At that unexpected response, I let out a stupid sound. <br />
　It’s true that Kujoin-san’s expression wasn’t cloudy at all, but it was rather cheerful. It didn’t seem like she was just being difficult.</p>

<p>“They say things like, 『The more people you have, the less love you have for one person,』 but that’s not true. I love all ten husbands with all my heart. I would fight for each and every one of them with my life. How many of those people who hurl foul words at me do you think are capable of doing the same?”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san said with a smile on his face. <br />
　It is certainly hard to believe that people who brazenly spout their opinions in the media are prepared to risk their lives for the sake of others.</p>

<p>“It’s just that they don’t have the capacity to love more than one person. I doubt they could even love one person enough.” <br />
“……Indeed, that may be the case.”</p>

<p>　If Kujoin and her husbands are happy, it’s disrespectful for those around them to complain about it. I have to be careful not to be biased, too.</p>

<p>“How’s that?　I hope my story will be able to serve as a reference for you.” <br />
“Reference ……?　What do you mean?”</p>

<p>　I tilted my head, not understanding what she was talking about. <br />
　Then, Kujoin-san put on a smirk and a happy expression on her face.</p>

<p>“Did you think I didn’t know about it?　Tanaka-kun, I heard that you have been popular lately. I like that kind of talk, so I know about it. There is a bright and energetic girl and a cool kid from the First Division. And Amatsuki, who has grown into a very beautiful woman. They are all good kids, and I can’t pick just one.” (Tl: Tch, Pick Amatsuki of course, she’s basically your daughter, not thhat it means much to someone with 10 husbands) <br />
“Na……!”</p>

<p>　I was hit by something unexpected, and I almost screamed out loud. <br />
　Not only Kujoin, but also the thin macho husbands were looking at me with warm eyes. Ha, I’m embarrassed …….</p>

<p>　Even so, I never thought that Kujoin-san knew about the three of them …… but what happened between me and the three of them has been distributed, spread, clipped and summarized in articles. If you looked it up, you could easily find it. <br />
　That means not only Kujoin-san, but tens of millions, maybe even over 100 million people know about it……. It was so far from reality that it was starting to make my head hurt.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to force you to do anything, but there are other ways than choosing one person. Of course you have to respect the other people’s opinion, though.”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san said and stood up holding a slip of paper. <br />
　I was about to get my wallet out, but Kujoin-san stopped me by holding her hand out to me.</p>

<p>“I will not let my senpai be embarrassed. Please let me pay this much.” <br />
“…… Understood, Thank you for the food.”</p>

<p>　She nodded her head in satisfaction and turned to leave the coffee shop, but then stopped.</p>

<p>“The person who has the power has the responsibility to use it properly. That’s what I believe. That is why I wield this power for the world and for others.”(Tl: “With great power…”)</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san spoke with a serious expression on her face. <br />
　Coming from a prominent family, she was neither short of money nor hungry for battle. And yet she put herself in the dangerous explorer business.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t mean I have to give up my happiness. I will live happily while fulfilling my duties. You should live for your own happiness.” <br />
“My own happiness…….”</p>

<p>　I feel like I’ve heard those words before. (Tl: From Adachi back in Volume 1) <br />
　I enjoyed the way I live now, but what exactly was my happiness ……?　I thought about it, but nothing seemed to fit.</p>

<p>“If you don’t know, act so that your important people can live happily. That, in turn, will make you happy.”(Tl: Wow this old lady is really speaking Wisdom)</p>

<p>　Important people? <br />
　There are many people I can think of. Certainly, I would be happy if they were happy. Kujoin-san’s words fell straight into my heart.</p>

<p>“I think you don’t need this kind of advice right now, though.” <br />
“No, it was very helpful. Thank you very much.” <br />
“Don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it. If you have a wedding or a baby, please invite me, okay?　I’ll be there with plenty of money.”(I need this king of people in my life) <br />
“Ha ha …… if there is such a thing, I promise.”</p>

<p>　Kujoin-san satisfied with my reply, nodded with a smile and left the coffee shop this time.</p>

<p>“Let’s go!” <br />
“”””””””"”Yes!　My Honey!””””””””””</p>

<p>　The husbands roll out the red carpet in a single breath. <br />
　Kujoin-san walked gracefully away on it with her husband pulling her by the hand.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Tl Note: Where do I even start this time? My examas will be over next week, so I’ll no longer have any excuse to not translate, though it only really afffects The Silver Castle Novel and not this one(Because of the Author’s slow realeases). Seems like someone posted a few Volume 1 Chapters on his site. Don’t know how to feel about that. Would have been a little easier if he just copied from this site, but it’s all his effort. I’m Probably going to contact him sooner or later, but I’m not keeping it on my mind cuz I have exams to study for. Need someone to help ask him what’s going on on his site. And what he plans to do moving forward. I feel like he just started and pumped out 6 chapters at once, just to find ot the novel was active, and posted his chapters so at least his work won’t be in vain. Love his site defsign though.</p>
