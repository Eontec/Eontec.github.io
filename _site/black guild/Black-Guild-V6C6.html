<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“……It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.”</p>

<p>　I muttered to myself as I looked at the building standing in front of me. The large building on the side looks like a general hospital. <br />
　  In this building, various special events related to dungeons, such as monsters, magical element, and magic, are researched.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Magic element is attracting worldwide attention as a new type of energy. <br />
　High concentrations of magical element have adverse effects on living creatures, but it does not produce harmful smoke. If it is handled properly, it will become the strongest clean energy.</p>

<p>　Japan’s Magick Research Bureau is also doing its best to tackle this problem, and it seems to be producing a certain amount of results. <br />
　The person who has contributed to this is the genius scientist I am about to meet, Maki Kurosu-san.</p>

<p>“Maki-san is also a bit of an oddball. …… I wonder if this souvenir will be enough.”</p>

<p>　I muttered to myself as I looked at the sweet-looking confectionery I had bought in Shinjuku. <br />
　Well, there’s no point in being anxious. I took a deep breath and went into the Magic Research Bureau.</p>

<p>　The interior was as clean and white as it had been in the past. The center of the building is a stairwell, with glass elevators going back and forth between the upper and lower floors. <br />
　In the first section, people in white coats were hurriedly moving around, and there was a faint smell of chemicals. <br />
　I went to the reception desk and told them what I had come for. A slender woman in a white coat soon arrived. She looks intelligent and wears glasses. This is probably the first time we have met.</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you, Tanaka-sama. Thank you for coming to see me. My name is Akira Fukami, Dr. Kurosu’s ninth assistant. Pleased to meet you.”</p>

<p>　The woman who introduced herself as Fukami bowed her head to me. <br />
　She bowed her head to me, her face was inorganic and her expression did not change, though her gesture was polite. I couldn’t quite figure out what she was thinking.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for your kind attention. My name is Makoto Tanaka. , I’m here to see Maki-san…… um, Director Kurosu.” <br />
“Yes. Dr. Kurosu is waiting for you in the back. Please come this way and I will show you around.”</p>

<p>　I followed behind Fukami-san as she walked with her heels clacking. <br />
　I look around as I walk. I hear what sounds like explosions from time to time, but I wonder what kind of research they are doing.　I wonder what kind of research they’re doing. I’m sure most of what I hear I don’t understand.</p>

<p>“Are you nervous?” <br />
“What?”</p>

<p>　Fukami-san noticed my fidgeting and turned around to ask me.</p>

<p>“Well…… yes. A little.” <br />
“On the first floor, we mainly study unknown materials collected in the dungeon. Ores, plants, and monster materials are among them. They are analyzed with state-of-the-art equipment and discussed in terms of how they can be useful to mankind.”</p>

<p>　With that, Fukami pushed the elevator button and got in. <br />
　I followed her lead and entered the elevator.</p>

<p>“On the second floor, we are doing basic research on magical element and a little bit on the phenomenon of magic. We have a separate Magic Analysis Bureau, so we leave the analysis of magic to them.” <br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>　These people are researchers by nature. <br />
　Actual magic is very contained and may be of little interest to them. Perhaps they’re more interested in unknown substances and new uses for magic essence.</p>

<p>“On the third floor, the applied research of magical elements…… is mainly concerned with their effects on the human body. This includes observation of changes in the structure of the human body when a person becomes awakened, and research on the mechanism of the increase or decrease of the allowable amount of magical element. The fourth floor is for more advanced research on magical element. And the fifth floor is …….”</p>

<p>　The elevator arrived at the top floor with a ding. <br />
　On the only floor that is not vaulted, there was a heavy metal door that looks like a safe.</p>

<p>“The fifth floor is Dr. Kurosu’s private research space. Only a limited number of people are allowed on this floor, and even assistants such as myself are not allowed to enter freely.”</p>

<p>　Fukami-san began fiddling with the terminal next to the metal door. <br />
　He punched in a PIN number, had his card key authenticated, and then went through the retina authentication process ……. It was quite strict.</p>

<p>“It’s very secure” <br />
“Dr. Kurosu is the greatest brain of Japan, the greatest treasure. It is only natural that it should be this strict.” <br />
“I see…….”</p>

<p>　It seems that Fukami-san has a great deal of respect for Maki-san. At a level that can be called worship. <br />
　Maybe most of the people who work here are like that. As I was thinking this, Fukami-san spoke into the microphone. It seems that he has connected with the inside.</p>

<p>“Dr. Kurosu. I have brought Makoto Tanaka-sama with me.”</p>

<p>　When Fukami-san said this into the microphone, it was answered only with a short “Okay,” and the metal door started to open. <br />
　The walls of this floor seem to be quite thick. A bomb wouldn’t be enough to break through. With such tight security, it is unlikely that anyone will try to break into this room.</p>

<p>“Please come in.”</p>

<p>　I walk behind Fukami-san and enter the room. <br />
　Then, a person welcomes us.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tanaka-kun, it’s been a while.”</p>

<p>　The person appeared, fluttering a white coat. <br />
　Tall and slender, with black-rimmed glasses. WIth an unlit cigarette in mouth and long black hair, messily tied back with a hair elastic. <br />
　What was most striking was the upper body. Maki-san was wearing a white lab coat directly on her skin, with nothing else on her upper body. It is not a naked apron, but a naked lab coat. In addition, her chest and navel are exposed because it is not buttoned up.</p>

<p>　If it were a man, it would not be such a problem, but…… Maki-san is a woman. Maki-san’s face is also well-shaped, and she is very popular among women.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it’s been so long, Maki-san. You are still dressed like that…….” <br />
“The white coat is the most excellent garment ever developed by man. If you have this, you don’t need any other clothes. I really want to take off the bothersome undergarments as well…… but Dojima-san forbids me to do so. The world of mankind is a very cramped place.”</p>

<p>　The owner of the strongest brain, the pride of Japan, spoke languidly of her desire to be exposed.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Tl Note: Tanaka really knows no normal people older than him.</p>
