…

　Ten years had already passed since the birth of dungeons in the world. 
　During that time, dungeons had been thoroughly investigated by researchers from all over the world, and the magical elements and awakened people could be explained fairly scientifically.

　Even so, however, the key 『dungeon 』  was still largely unexplained.

　Where did they come from? What is their purpose? 
　Were they natural phenomena? Or were they artificially created?
　The more one investigates, the more one learns, and that is the biggest mystery of all. 
　Maki may have solved part of that mystery.

“Come on!　It’s time for some fun, fun experimentation!”

　Maki operated a panel on the wall, and a mechanical platform appeared in the center of the room that seemed to have a variety of functions. There were several other futuristic devices in this room, the purpose of which was unknown. 
　I bet they all cost an eye-popping amount of money.

“Maki-san, you may examine Riri, but please don’t do anything …… violent, okay?”

“I’m sorry to bother you.”

“Welcome.”

　When I entered the house, I was greeted by a beastman.

　Like Luna, he had white hair. He was about sixty years old. He looked quite old.

“My name is Tungul. Please have a seat here.”

　I sat down on the cushion placed in front of him as Mr. Tungul urged me.

…

　Director of the Bureau of Magical Research, Kurosu Maki. 
　If I had to sum her up in one word, it would be “eccentric”.

　She loves research so much that she has no interest in anything else. The fact that she wears only a white coat on her upper body probably stems from her lack of interest in clothing.  
　She only eats solid, complete nutritional food, and the sleep she takes is minimal. She has no desire for money or to be popular with the opposite sex.

　The beastmen in Seven Knights Online were a bit rough around the edges, but this man was quite calm and rational. It is dangerous to make assumptions based on in-game impressions.
