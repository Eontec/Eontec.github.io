Tl: Sam

…

　After defeating the bandits in the cave and saving the people who were being held captive, I returned to the Jimari village.

　I could have returned home immediately by riding the angel I summoned, but the captives, especially the priest, refused, saying, “ That’s absurd!” I had to walk home.

　Angels are just monsters that I can summon as many as I want, but to the people here, they are sacred beings.

　I should not treat them too carelessly.

“Welcome back, Dyle-sama!”

…

　—-Time goes back a bit.

　That day I was thinking about something.

　It was about the concept of 『level』 in this world.

　The magic 《Level Seeing》, which allows you to check the level of your opponent. When I used this on people in this world, it would normally activate and I could check their level.

…

“……It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.”

　I muttered to myself as I looked at the building standing in front of me. The large building on the side looks like a general hospital. 
　  In this building, various special events related to dungeons, such as monsters, magical element, and magic, are researched.

　Tl: Sam

…

　It was the 《Angel Arrow》, a magic used by angels. It is less powerful, but comes out quickly and has a slight holy attribute.

　It’s a magic that doesn’t serve as a deterrent against players, but it’s quite effective against thieves.

“Ugh, ah……!”

　 The bandit’s face contorted in pain as he held his thigh, which had a hole in it.

　 The bandit’s face is contorted in pain as he holds the hole in his thigh.

“Why are you doing this?”

Tl: Sam

…

　There was a group of people silently advancing through the forest.

　They were clad in light and durable leather armor, and had handy daggers at their waists.

　They were dressed in dirty clothes and had stubble on their mouths.

　They do not look like ordinary people to anyone.

　They were bandits who had this forest area as their territory.

　They make their living by raiding villages and wagons and stealing money and food.
