“If the amount is correct, please sign your signature. Or is there something wrong with ……?” 
“No, no. No, no, this is fine. I’ll sign it.”

　I can’t complain about this. 
　There was nothing against me in the document, so I had no problem with it.

　I signed in three places and stamped my seal. Then I noticed a piece of paper that looked like colored paper in the document.

“We have been waiting for you, Mr. Tanaka!　Please have a seat here!”

　Hazuki-san, seeing my face, smiled and guided me to a chair. 
　It was a private room, different from the general reception area where I had first spoken to her. The chairs were leather and comfortable, and the desk was made of good wood. Obviously, this is the kind of room one would use to talk to someone of great standing.

“Well…… can we get right into the formalities now?” 
“Yes, that’s fine.”

“Thank you for waiting. I brought you some tea, coffee, and cookies.”

　While conversing with Kujoin, the coffee shop clerk came over and placed the order on the table. 
　Kujoin-san said, “Thank you,” and tipped the waiter, then sipped her tea with an elegant gesture. As I recall, Kujoin-san came from a prominent family. She should have had no trouble living a normal life, so why did she become a dangerous explorer? 
　I suddenly wondered that.

“I understand that there are people who can’t accept the fact that I have so many husbands…… because I’ve been told that a lot too.”

…

　I walked through the cave with those who had been captured.

　I cast a 《Heal》 spell on them, so that they would be light on their feet.

“Um… Thank you, just now.”

“Hmmm?”

　The one who spoke to me was the beastman girl who had been attacked by bandits.

…

　My 《Job》 is a holy knight.

　It is a versatile job that can handle both melee and magic. The unique equipment is also cool and popular.

　However, this “job” is not very popular among the top players.

　The holy knight can do everything on his own, but he is not very versatile. Berserkers” and “mages” are more popular because they are irreplaceable and excel at one thing.

　But I still prefer the holy knight because of its attack speed.
