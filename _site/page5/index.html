“Ugh, it hurts …….”

　I rushed to the scene and found one villager there moaning in pain.

　There was a large cut on his abdomen. Was this the cause?

“I’ll help you now. Recovery 《Heal》.”

　A green light was absorbed into the wound, and in no time at all the wound was healed.

…

　The village’s field improvement project went smoothly, and in a week’s time, all the deserted fields were filled with abundant crops.

　The vegetables and fruits grown were all popular in Seven Knights Online. All of them are full of nutrients, and all the villagers who ate them became full of energy.

　……It’s obvious that their muscle power and magic power have been increased from normal humans, but it’s okay, right?

…

“Um, uh, you know, ……, it’s been a while.” 
“Is that so?　I feel like we just met the other day. Just the two of us.”

　When I talked to Amatsuki while I was flustered, I was cut down so quickly.

　I had met Amatsuki at a park at night the other day. 
　At that time, she told me how much she liked me and took my lips. Even now, when I think back to that time, I am so embarrassed that my face almost catches fire. 
　I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to express that now, though.

…

“Thank you……. I’m fine now.”

　Hoshino, who had been leaning against me for a while, said that and moved away from me. 
　She was still tired, but she was able to stand firmly on her own two feet. I think with this she’ll be able to walk home.

“Tanaka-san always helps me out when I’m in a pinch, don’t you? After all, Tanaka-san is my hero, thank you so much!”

…

　A man from the village took me to his house, where I found a woman lying there looking limp.

　Her face was blue and she seemed to be in a lot of pain.

　I bent down beside her to check on her.

“Dyle-san, is my wife going to die?”
