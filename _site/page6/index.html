…

　It had been three days since we had stayed in the village of Jimali.

　Of course, I could not eat and drink for free. I spent my time hunting beasts in the forest and using magic to solve the problems of the villagers.

　While I was doing this …… I was completely accepted by the villagers.

「Eeeh!　Yui-chan, you’re in danger!」 
「What are you doing?　Get out of there!」 
「Shachiken, go help her!」 
「Wait, it’s really dangerous!」

　The viewers were typing their comments as they watched Hoshino standing in the way of the bamo craft. 
　It was indeed quite a dangerous sight from the side. Even though he was wounded, the opponent was an SS-ranked monster. It was still too much for the young Hoshino to handle.    
　But,

『 Booooooooo…… 』

　The abnormally grown individual minotaur, Bamocraft let out a low snarl as it looked at me.

　His nose was breathing hard and drool was spilling out of his mouth. 
　He seemed to be very angry because he was interrupted from his fun time.

　However, he seemed to have a sense of reason and didn’t jump on me right away. I guess he was just wary of the fact that his axe was broken.

…

　When I arrive at the house of  Gafas-san, the village chief, I take off my armor and get into a comfortable outfit.

　I don’t have to take it off by hand, though. I just open the 《  console  》 and remove my equipment, and the armor disappears in an instant. This system seems to be the same as in the game.

　Incidentally, the 《 console 》 screen can also be seen by Shea and the village chief. Both of them said they had never seen such a screen before, so it seems that there are not many people who can use it in this world.

　On the way to the village, I hear various things from Shea.

　This forest where I am now is called “Yuld Forest,” located in the northern part of the Eurysia continent.

　To the north of the forest is the Nord Sea. If I had fallen into it, I would have died. I can’t thank the Silver Castle enough for doing its best to fly us to the land.

　And as for the question of whether or not this is a game world…… the theory that this is not a game world is gaining strength.
