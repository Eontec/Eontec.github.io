  <p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>” …… where am I?”</p>

<p>　I pick myself up, holding my head.</p>

<p>There is a deep forest spreading out in front of me　.</p>

<p>　There are several forests in Seven Knights Online, but this look different from any of them. You might think that I can’t distinguish between forests, but I can.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　The game has different trees in different areas. The trees here are different from any other trees I’ve seen in the game.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make sense. If I died, I should be sent back to the respawn point.”</p>

<p>　This is the first time I’ve been resurrected in a place I don’t recognize.</p>

<p>　I first operated the console to open up the map. I thought I would be able to find out where I was by looking at the worlld map…… but I was wrong.</p>

<p>“What is this?　I’ve never seen NO DATA…… like this before.”</p>

<p>　Even if it is the first time to go to a new place, it shows where it is on the whole map.</p>

<p>　This is the first time that even the whole map is not displayed like this. The first thing that comes to mind as a possible cause is a bug. But if it is a bug, there is nothing I can do.</p>

<p>“I should contact the management. ……No, I think I need to make sure it’s safe first.”</p>

<p>　The forest may look peaceful, but you never know what kind of vicious monsters might be out there.</p>

<p>　Information is a weapon. I need to check out the situation and make sure we are safe.</p>

<p>“Activate skill 〈 Detect Presence〉”</p>

<p>　Unlike magic, a skill is a technique that does not consume MP.</p>

<p>　The “Detect  Presence” skill is one of the skills that players can learn, and is useful for detecting the location of players and monsters within a certain range.</p>

<p>　The skill does not use MP, but it cannot be used indefinitely, and after a certain number of uses, a 《 cooldown time 》 will be given for reuse.</p>

<p>　The more powerful the skill, the longer the 《 cooldown time 》 . However, since “Detecting presence” is an easy skill to learn, the cool time is as short as 10 seconds, so it can be used with ease.</p>

<p>“Ah ……. There is a presence a short distance away. The presences that are actively moving are monsters. The one being chased by them is the player. Is he being attacked by monsters?”</p>

<p>　If so, I should help.</p>

<p>　Not just because that person is likely to have information. I’m on the side of justice as long as I’m in this avatar. Even if I am in a land that I don’t understand, I have to fulfill my role.</p>

<p>“I’m coming for you……!”</p>

<p>　I put strength into my legs and run as fast as I can.</p>

<p>　The first job of my character “Wang Dyle” is the main job of the holy knight.</p>

<p>　It is a versatile job that is strong in both swordsmanship and magic. My athleticism is, of course, high.</p>

<p>　I can move lightly even though I wear heavy armor. There are many players who are caught off guard by the heavy appearance and are killed instantly.</p>

<p>“There……!”</p>

<p>　There is a girl running 10 meters ahead.</p>

<p>　A ferocious-looking wolf is chasing after it with its fangs bared.</p>

<p>　The girl is running hard, but the wolf’s fangs are almost behind her. It was only a matter of time before she fell prey.</p>

<p>“Kya……!”</p>

<p>　The girl trips on a tree root on the ground and falls.</p>

<p>　The wolf doesn’t miss the opportunity and tries to sink its fangs into her soft body.</p>

<p>“No……..”</p>

<p>　The girl’s face is stained with despair.</p>

<p>　The moment the wolf’s fangs are thrust into her, I manage to shield her from the wolf’s fangs.</p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>“hee……?”</p>

<p>　The girl stares at me in surprise.</p>

<p>　I don’t think she understands what’s going on.</p>

<p>　Well, I’ll explain when it’s all over. We need to get you safe.</p>

<p>“Get away!”</p>

<p>　I hit the wolf that is biting my back with my fist.</p>

<p>　The wolf is blown away and rolls on the ground.</p>

<p>　And then, seeing the wolf that didn’t move at all, the other four wolves are wary of me and move away from me.</p>

<p>“Now’s my chance.”</p>

<p>　I quickly open the console and take out a recovery potion. I open the lid and hand it to the girl.</p>

<p>“Take this and wait for me. I’ll finish it right away.”</p>

<p>“Uh, yes.”</p>

<p>　The girl, perhaps understanding that I have no hostile intentions, obediently listens to what I say.</p>

<p>　Now, let’s make this quick.</p>

<p>“Let’s get this over with. Justice will be served.”</p>

<p>　I say the words that only I can say now, the signature line of the Knights of the Silver Knights.</p>

<p>　There were a lot of ideas for the line, but this simple line seemed to be the right one. I thought it was cool straight from the perspective of a guy who used to like the Sentai Hero(Tl: The predecessor of Power Rangers) stuff, but I was too embarrassed to say anything about it, so I kept my mouth shut.</p>

<p>『 Lulu …… Grrrr!”』</p>

<p>　One wolf bared its fangs and attacked.</p>

<p>　The only other way to attack it is with fangs and claws. The wolf monsters in 《 Seven Knights Online 》 have powerful magic, but this one doesn’t seem to have that.</p>

<p>“Cutting 《Slash》.”</p>

<p>　With a snap of my fingers, I activate the magic and the wolf’s body is severed from the torso.</p>

<p>　The wolf’s body is cut in two from the torso, and then it falls down, staining the ground red with bright red blood.</p>

<p>“Eeee!”</p>

<p>　I turn my face away from the grotesque sight.</p>

<p>　What is going on?　In  ｜《 Seven Knights Online 》, defeated monsters are immediately turned into materials, and even if you attack them, they don’t bleed like this.</p>

<p>『  Garr! 』</p>

<p>『 Rugaga!”』</p>

<p>　The wolves attack all at once.</p>

<p>　They must have thought they had a chance to win when they saw me turn my face away.</p>

<p>“No time to think, huh?”</p>

<p>　The incident earlier is bothering me, but I put it to the back of my mind and concentrate on the battle.</p>

<p>　The other wolf’s movements are monotonous. I’m not a beginner that’d fall to such a straight line attack.</p>

<p>　I step and duck from the attack and go around to the side of the wolf. Then, I press my right hand against the wolf’s torso and invoke magic.</p>

<p>“《 Thunderbolt! 》”</p>

<p>『 Gawrrr! 』</p>

<p>　With a “bang” sound, the lightning hits the wolf!　</p>

<p>　The wolf seems to have no resistance to attribute attacks, and is crushed by a single elementary magic like 《Thunder 》.</p>

<p>“The wolf’s body is not as grotesque as it was when it was cut by《Slash》, but I don’t like the smell of burning…….”</p>

<p>　I thought using 《 Thunderbolt 》 was a good idea, but that’s also rejected.</p>

<p>　The best way to do this is to use a magic that can be used to make the wolves look like wolves. I launch my magic at the two remaining wolves.</p>

<p>“《Wide Ice》”</p>

<p>　By adding more magic power, I strengthen the range of the 《 Ice 》 spell.</p>

<p>　Thanks to this, a wide area in front of me is instantly frozen, and the two wolves that had been standing apart to watch are frozen together.</p>

<p>　This is neither grotesque nor smelly. It’s all ice.</p>

<p>“Well, are you all right?”</p>

<p>“Hyah, hyah!”</p>

<p>　I turn around and ask the girl, and she makes a crazy sound.</p>

<p>　Well, If I was being attacked by wolves, but I was rescued by a mysterious knight in armor. I’m sure I’d be surprised.</p>

<p>“Let’s see…… can I ask your name first?”</p>

<p>“Yes. My name is Shea.”</p>

<p>　She was a girl in her early teens.</p>

<p>　She is a beautiful girl with purple hair and an innocent-looking face. She is very different from me, who was teased for having eyes deader than a dead fish.</p>

<p>“Thank you for saving me, Sir Knight. If you hadn’t come to my rescue, I would be in the belly of a wolf right now. Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>　Shea bowed her head deeply.</p>

<p>　She may look young, but she is intelligent and calm.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I did what I had to do. I’d like to ask you a few more questions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course!　Yes, of course!　Ask me anything you want!”</p>

<p>　Shea responds by tapping her chest.</p>

<p>　It seems that I’ve made a good impression by helping her out earlier. That’s a big help.</p>

<p>　I first ask her what I’m most worried about.</p>

<p>“Well, Shea is a player, right?”</p>

<p>　I have to check this first.</p>

<p>　Non-player characters, or NPCs, are not as expressive as she is, and they can only speak in a certain way. The skill 〈 Detect Presence 〉 also showed that it was a player, so there is no doubt about it.</p>

<p>　However, my opinion was easily overturned.</p>

<p>“Player?　What is it?”</p>

<p>　Shea tilts her head in a cute way.</p>

<p>　What are you talking about, ……?　How can you not know the word “player”?</p>

<p>　Shea, however, did not seem to be joking. She answered seriously. What the hell is going on?</p>

<p>We’re in a game, right? We’re in ｜Seven Knights Online, right?</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!　｜What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Such ……It doesn’t make any sense……!”</p>

<p>　The girl in trouble in front of me looks like a living person.</p>

<p>　What then?　Are you saying that I’m a game character and I’ve been transported to a world where humans are alive?</p>

<p>　…… Thinking about it, it’s strange that Shea is the player.</p>

<p>　In ｜The Heroic Tale of the Seven Swords Knight 《Seven Knights Online》, from an ethical point of view, it is not possible to create an avatar with the appearance of a child.</p>

<p>　And this is not limited to Seven Knights Online.</p>

<p>　In almost all FD (Full Dive) style MMOPRGs, except for R-18 ones, it is not possible to create and control child characters.</p>

<p>　So, is Shea really a living person and not a game avatar or NPC?</p>

<p>　That’s absurd. This is not a novel or a comic book.(Tl: If only he knew)</p>

<p>“That’s impossible. ……!”</p>

<p>　I operated the console with a sense of frustration.</p>

<p>　The first thing I looked for was the “logout” section.</p>

<p>　Seven Knights Online allows you to forcibly log out of the game no matter where you are on the map.</p>

<p>　If you log out outside of the city or safety area, only your avatar will remain, but there is always a way to return to the real world.</p>

<p>　The logout section of the game …… is cleanly gone, even though it should have been right there.</p>

<p>　All the other functions to contact others or the management, such as the message function, contact function, etc., were also gone.</p>

<p>　It’s a dead end.</p>

<p>　There was no way to return to the map of Seven Knights Online or the real world.</p>

<p>　Hopelessness weighs strongly on my shoulders.</p>

<p>　I’ve been through many adverse war situations in my life, but this is the first time I’ve felt so helpless.</p>

<p>　I looked over at Shea and saw her looking at me uneasily.</p>

<p>　……What am I doing? I need to do something about this girl before I worry. It’s not too late to start thinking about this world.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I’m a little distraught. By the way, where did Shea come from?</p>

<p>“Well, I’m from the village of Zimari, near here. A while ago I heard a loud noise and wondered what it was, so I went into the forest to search for it and was attacked by wolves.”</p>

<p>“I see, so that’s what happened. By the way, did you find out what that loud noise was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. Yes, a little further from here. There is a big castle that had collapsed on the cliff facing the sea. I don’t think there was a building like that before. ……”</p>

<p>“A big castle……!”</p>

<p>　Shea’s words startled me.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure if it’s possible. I had to make sure of it.</p>

<p>“Shea. I promise to take you back to the village. So will you take me to where that castle used to be?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, let’s make this quick.”</p>

<p>　I picked up Shea and carried her on my shoulder.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure if she was surprised or not, but she let out a cute little cry. She made a cute little noise.</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Uh, that way.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>　I ran in the direction she pointed.</p>
