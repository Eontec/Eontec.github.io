<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　Two minutes of running through the forest.</p>

<p>　I reach the place where Shea said there was a “big castle.</p>

<p>“This is ……!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　What I find in front of me is without a doubt the Silver Castle.</p>

<p>It was broken here and there because of the crash, but there was no way I can mistake it for anything else. The Silver Castle had come to this world, too…….!</p>

<p>“Fufufu…… ha ha ha!”</p>

<p>　I can’t help but laugh out loud.</p>

<p>　Alone in this world, I thought so. But I had my last and strongest ally with me. I can’t think of anything more reassuring than that.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, is something wrong ……?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Shea, for showing me this castle!　How can I thank you!”</p>

<p>“Umiu, how nice of you.”</p>

<p>　I thank Shea, shaking her shoulders.</p>

<p>　If it hadn’t been for her, I wouldn’t have known that the Silver Castle was there.</p>

<p>“But it’s broken pretty spectacularly. It won’t be able to fly for a while.”</p>

<p>　The castle has overturned. It will be difficult to get it straightened out.</p>

<p>　I touched a part of the castle and brought up the console for the management of the hideout.</p>

<p>“All right……. The fact that the console appears means that it wasn’t completely broken. The energy is …… almost depleted, of course. The materials and weapons in the warehouse are still there, which is nice to see. But most of the equipment and devices have been destroyed, and it’s going to take a lot of work to fix them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, um, …….”</p>

<p>　As I was mumbling and thinking, Shea spoke to me apologetically.</p>

<p>　Oops, I got carried away.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“I’m just thinking about it. Could it be that it belongs to you?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see………”</p>

<p>　Not exactly.</p>

<p>　This silver castle belongs to all the guild members.</p>

<p>　 But all those friends are gone. Not only in this world, but also in Seven Knights Online. Then…..</p>

<p>“Well, something like that ……?</p>

<p>“I knew it!”</p>

<p>　The most important thing to remember is that you can’t just go out and buy a new one.</p>

<p>　 The most important thing to remember is that you should never be afraid to ask for help.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s a good feeling or not. May I ask your name, if you don’t mind?</p>

<p>I haven’t told you my name yet. My name is Wang Dyle.</p>

<p>“Wang Dyle-sama ……, you are a king after all!” (Tl: Wang = King)</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no, no, no. ……”</p>

<p>“How could the King save a village girl like me?　How kind he is…….”</p>

<p>　No. I completely lost my timing to correct it.</p>

<p>　And if I corrected it now, I would disappoint Shea. I didn’t want to do that.</p>

<p>“Where did Dyle-sama come from?”</p>

<p>“What?　Oh, …… far away. I’ve come a long way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. So you came from a different continent outside of Eurysia?”</p>

<p>　It seems that this is the continent of Eurysia.</p>

<p>　I’ve never heard of such a name in reality or in Seven Knights Online.</p>

<p>　The first thing to do now is to gather information. I’ll see what happens after that.</p>

<p>“Then, Shea, will you take me to the village next? Next, can you show me the way to the village?　I actually don’t know much about this area. I’d appreciate it if you could tell me a little bit about the area.”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it to you!　I can’t give you great hospitality, but I’ll do my best ……!”</p>

<p>　Shea is very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>　 I’ll have to cherish this connection.</p>

<p>“By the way, are you sure you want to keep the castle as it is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it can’t be moved, so it will stay as it is. I can’t move it, so I’ll leave it as it is. But I’ll make sure it can’t be found.”</p>

<p>　I operate the 《 console  》 and turn on the camouflage 《 stealth 》 function.</p>

<p>　Then the silver castle blends into the air and becomes invisible. Thank goodness this function wasn’t broken.</p>

<p>“Wow!　The castle has disappeared!　Huh?　But it’s here when I touch it: ……. Is this magic too?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, something like that.”</p>

<p>“Huh. …… magic is amazing.”</p>

<p>　Shea says as if impressed.</p>

<p>　It seems that magic exists in this world too, but they don’t get a chance to see it very often.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s get going. Show me the way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!　This way!”</p>

<p>　And so began my adventure into the unknown.</p>
