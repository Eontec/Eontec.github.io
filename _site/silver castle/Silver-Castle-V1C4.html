<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>.
…</p>

<p>　On the way to the village, I hear various things from Shea.</p>

<p>　This forest where I am now is called “Yuld Forest,” located in the northern part of the Eurysia continent.</p>

<p>　To the north of the forest is the Nord Sea. If I had fallen into it, I would have died. I can’t thank the Silver Castle enough for doing its best to fly us to the land.</p>

<p>　And as for the question of whether or not this is a game world…… the theory that this is not a game world is gaining strength.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　First, I lightly cut my own arm with my sword.</p>

<p>　There was a sharp pain and red blood flowed. In addition, I felt hungry, so I ate some berries and felt a sensation of being filled up. I can’t reproduce such a feeling in the games of my time.</p>

<p>　In other words, this is a fantasy world similar to Seven Knights Online. I had wandered into it as a game character.</p>

<p>　It’s impossible, but I have no choice but to believe so.</p>

<p>　Well, it’s better than being thrown out in my real world body. In that body, the monsters would kill me and that would be the end of it.</p>

<p>“I see it!　That’s the Jimari village!”</p>

<p>　Shea, who is riding on my shoulder, shouts.</p>

<p>　My avatar is over two meters tall, so she is looking at me from a very high angle.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that it?”</p>

<p>　The village that appears is a very deserted countryside village.</p>

<p>　The population of the village is probably around a hundred.</p>

<p>　</p>

<p>　The villagers worked on the farm and hid in the shadows when they saw me.</p>

<p>　Well, it is surprising to see a big man in armor suddenly appear, isn’t it? I am lucky they did not attack me.</p>

<p>　When I enter the village from the front, I am greeted by three adults.</p>

<p>　In the middle is an old man with a beard. He is flanked by two men with axes in their hands.</p>

<p>　When I stop in front of them, the old man opens his mouth.</p>

<p>“I am Gafas, the village chief. How can I help you in this village, knight-dono?”</p>

<p>　The chief’s tone is polite, but he seems wary.</p>

<p>　The men behind him are shaking as they hold their axes. I think I’m scaring them a lot.</p>

<p>“Uh… …..”</p>

<p>“Gafas-san!　I was saved by this man!”</p>

<p>　As I wonder how I should explain this, Shea jumps down from my shoulder and explains.</p>

<p>　The villagers are surprised to see her, perhaps unaware of her presence because of how she has blended in with my armor.</p>

<p>“Shea!　Why are you here?”</p>

<p>“Actually……”</p>

<p>　Shea tells Gafas-san, who is respectful, how she met me.</p>

<p>　The location of the castle, which is currently camouflaged by stealth, is something I asked her not to tell anyone.</p>

<p>　It would be risky for others to know its location. I would like to keep it as secret as possible until I have a clear idea of how to supply energy and can install a defense system.</p>

<p>　While I am thinking about this, Shea finishes explaining the general situation.</p>

<p>　At this point, the two villagers lower the axe in their hands. It is a good thing, because it is not a pleasant feeling to have hostility directed at you.</p>

<p>“…… excuse me,  Dyle-dono. Though I did not know it, I was rude to my benefactor.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s fine. It is natural that you would be afraid of me because of my appearance.”</p>

<p>“Oh ……, how merciful of you. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity.”</p>

<p>　With that, Gafas-san and the two villagers lower their heads.</p>

<p>　Phew, I’m glad we managed to do this. I would not have been able to have such perfect communication alone, thanks to Shea.</p>

<p>“You must be tired. Stay at my house today. We are not a rich village, so we can’t offer you much hospitality. ……”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. As long as you give me a place to sleep, I will be fine.”</p>

<p>As I am talking with Gafas, Shea interrupts.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama!　Why don’t you stay at my house?”</p>

<p>“Shea, your house is too small for Dyle-dono, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Muu!”</p>

<p>　Gafas-san admonished, but Shea is not satisfied.</p>

<p>　I didn’t think shea would miss me this much.</p>

<p>“Shea, I’ll be back later, so don’t annoy the village chief so much”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>I pat Shea on the head and console her, and then head to the house with Gafas-san.</p>
