<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　When I arrive at the house of  Gafas-san, the village chief, I take off my armor and get into a comfortable outfit.</p>

<p>　I don’t have to take it off by hand, though. I just open the 《  console  》 and remove my equipment, and the armor disappears in an instant. This system seems to be the same as in the game.</p>

<p>　Incidentally, the 《 console 》 screen can also be seen by Shea and the village chief. Both of them said they had never seen such a screen before, so it seems that there are not many people who can use it in this world.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　So it would be better not to open the 《  console  》 screen in public.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your hospitality.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s nothing. I am sorry that I can only prepare something like this.”</p>

<p>　The dishes prepared by his wife were lined up in front of me.</p>

<p>　Soup with vegetables and bread. A dish that looked like grilled fish and boiled beans.</p>

<p>　It may not be the most lavish of meals, but I can tell he is trying to entertain me as best he can.</p>

<p>“You are a benefactor. It would be polite to offer you more hospitality, but …… we don’t have much food in stock because of the recent crop failure. I beg your indulgence.”</p>

<p>　Gafas-san looks apologetic.</p>

<p>　Apparently, the food situation is serious. Looking back, many of the villagers were also very thin.</p>

<p>　And yet, they were nice enough to offer me, a complete stranger, what little food they had. When I think of their circumstances, I am tempted to refrain from eating, but to do so would be to disrespect their goodwill.</p>

<p>　Rather than refrain from eating, I should finish my meal and do something to help them later.</p>

<p>　I take a sip of the soup they’ve prepared for me and gulp it down.</p>

<p>“……Yeah, it’s delicious. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that. I have also prepared a small amount of sake for you. Please drink it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>　Neither the food nor the sake tasted very good.</p>

<p>　But I feel warm inside.</p>

<p>(……I wonder how long it has been since I had a meal like this.)</p>

<p>　When I was a member of the Silver Knights, I ate dinner in the game every day.</p>

<p>　It didn’t fill my actual stomach, but chatting with everyone and eating dinner filled my heart with that feeling.</p>

<p>　It reminded me a little of that feeling.</p>

<p>“Dyle-dono?”</p>

<p>　Gafas-san looks at me with concern.</p>

<p>　It seems I had shed tears without realizing it. I hastily wipe them away and apologize.</p>

<p>“Did I do something wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not like that. I was just reminiscing a little about the past.”</p>

<p>　When I answer, Gafas-san did not ask me any more questions.</p>

<p>　I guess he’s being considerate of my feelings. He is a mature man.</p>

<p>“By the way, Dyle-dono. I have heard from Shea that you are the king of a land far from here. What brought you to this land?　Of course, if you have a reason you cannot tell me, then you have not heard this question.”</p>

<p>　Gafas-san asked with great care.</p>

<p>　Well, it is natural to be curious about that. It’s not normal for the king of another country to come here with nothing on his person.</p>

<p>　He knows that I can use powerful magic, so it’s no wonder he thinks I’m here to invade.</p>

<p>“…… Actually, my country was destroyed once. I’m traveling alone in search of a new land. Please rest assured that I am not here to cause strife.”</p>

<p>“No, I have no such concerns, so please rest assured!”</p>

<p>　Gafas-san mends as if in a hurry.</p>

<p>　Was I a little too intrusive in my response?　Well, it would be better to have a heart-to-heart talk. I’d like to continue to be friends with this village.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t realize there was such a situation. I’m sure you will have a hard time from now on, but please take your time in this empty village.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>　I thank him and go back to eating.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>　That night.</p>

<p>　I couldn’t sleep for some reason, so I went outside.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s because I’m in this body now that I don’t feel very sleepy.”</p>

<p>　In the real world, I was always sluggish because of my inactivity.</p>

<p>　But now I am light. I have so much strength in my body that I can run all day long.</p>

<p>　I could try changing jobs, but that would be a waste of time.</p>

<p>　In Seven Knights Online, there is a facility where you can change your main job, and you can pay money to change your job.</p>

<p>　The only way to change your main job is to pay for an item at the facility. I have that item, but it’s a waste to use it since I don’t have the means to replenish it.</p>

<p>　By the way, you can change your “subjob” at will. This one has no effect on status, so I’m not going to change it now.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Well, I guess we’ll just have to test it out a little bit at a time.”</p>

<p>　When I first came to this world, I was in a panic, but now I am strangely calm.</p>

<p>　This is probably because of my high status, and I think it’s affecting my mentality as well. If I were the usual me, I would still be in a panic.</p>

<p>“I guess I really am in the body of my game character …….”</p>

<p>　Hmmm.</p>

<p>　I guess a normal person would be depressed, but I don’t really feel that way.</p>

<p>　I’ve been in the game longer than I’ve been in the “real world” to begin with.</p>

<p>　My immediate goal is to repair the castle. But what should I do after that?</p>

<p>　If I go back the way I came, I might be able to return to the world of Seven Knights Online.</p>

<p>　But what would be the point of going back?</p>

<p>　I have no friends in the game, and I have no regrets about the real world.</p>

<p>　If that is the case, I might be happier living in this world.</p>

<p>　I’m lucky enough to have made some good friends.</p>

<p>“Fua…. I’m finally getting sleepy.”</p>

<p>　It seems that this body does have sleepiness.</p>

<p>　It would be convenient if I didn’t have to sleep, but it would be sad to lose the pleasure of sleep. This might be a good thing.</p>

<p>　I returned to the village chief’s house and slept comfortably, trying not to make a sound.</p>
