<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　It had been three days since we had stayed in the village of Jimali.</p>

<p>　Of course, I could not eat and drink for free. I spent my time hunting beasts in the forest and using magic to solve the problems of the villagers.</p>

<p>　While I was doing this …… I was completely accepted by the villagers.
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Dyle-sama!　Thank you for the other day!”</p>

<p>“I just picked some fresh vegetables!　If you don’t mind, please take some!”</p>

<p>　As I was walking with Shea, I was approached by villagers.</p>

<p>　It’s kind of itchy.</p>

<p>“As expected of Dyle-sama!　You’re totally popular!”</p>

<p>　Shea said excitedly.</p>

<p>“It seems that the villagers finally understand how great you are!”</p>

<p>“I’m not that great, Shea.”</p>

<p>“Kuu, such modesty is also wonderful!”</p>

<p>“…… That’s very kind of you.”</p>

<p>　Shea is still very fond of me.</p>

<p>　I thought the fever would cool down in a few days, but it looks like it’s going to last a while.</p>

<p>“I’m home.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to bother you.”</p>

<p>　I entered her house with Shea.</p>

<p>　My head almost hit the door, but I bent down to avoid it.</p>

<p>　I’m not sure I’d fit in a normal person’s house with my body like this. ｜The  buildings in the world of “Seven Knights Online” were made quite large.</p>

<p>“What a surprise! Welcome, Dyle-sama. Let me prepare some tea.”</p>

<p>　When I entered the house, I was greeted by Anna, Shea’s mother.</p>

<p>　Shea’s father passed away a few years ago, and now she and Anna live together as mother and son.</p>

<p>　When she found out that I had saved her, she thanked me so much that I thought my head was going to hit the ground.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama. What do you want to know today?”</p>

<p>　When we got to the table, Shea brought a lot of books from her room and put them in front of me.</p>

<p>　Shea had been teaching me a lot of things about this world lately.</p>

<p>　There are many things I needed to know about geography, history, climate, and so on. I can’t read the script of this world, so having Shea as an interpreter was a big help to me.</p>

<p>“Even so, it’s amazing that she can read at her age. Shea is going to be a great person.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>　She smiled happily as I said this to Anna-san, who put the tea down for me.</p>

<p>　It’s not a joke, it’s an established fact. Only a few people in this village can read. Even in a prosperous town, there are not that many people who can read.</p>

<p>　And yet Shea learned to read and write at such a young age. This must be a talent.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of sending her to the royal academy in a little while. If she stays in this village, she won’t be able to study much.”</p>

<p>“That’s wonderful. I am sure it will be a good experience.”</p>

<p>　It is not my right to say this, since I had never been to school, but I think she should study.</p>

<p>　Otherwise, you would become a useless person like me.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama, please don’t just talk to your mother all the time!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Well, …… can I ask you to think with me today about how we can fix my castle?”</p>

<p>　I had learned quite a bit about this world, but I was still no closer to fixing the Silver Castle.</p>

<p>　The internal organs had almost stopped working and the outer walls were falling apart. I felt sorry for it if it stays like that, and I wanted to fix it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“How can we fix the castle? I know there are many architects in the capital, but I don’t think they can fix the castle.”</p>

<p>“I see. That castle is different from ordinary castles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. Yes, and there is also the problem of materials. I read in a book that buildings with magical effects use a lot of rare metals such as mithril. We also have to think about how to procure them.”</p>

<p>　……After all, Shea’s brains outstrip those of the other villagers.</p>

<p>　If she joins me, she’ll be an excellent staff officer.</p>

<p>“Rare metal, huh? Certainly, it wouldn’t be a problem if there were more of it. Is there something like a mine near this village?”</p>

<p>“There is a small mine nearby, but it is not possible to mine fine ore there. If there is, it is here ……. There is a mountain range in the south of the country, and I think we can get it here.”</p>

<p>“There is …….”</p>

<p>　Shea, with the map open, pointed to a mountain range.</p>

<p>　It is quite a distance, but if you use magic, it will not take long.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that these mountains are inhabited by dwarves, dwarves who work with iron. If we can get them to join us, they will be a great help in fixing the castle.”</p>

<p>“…… Excellent. It is an impeccable suggestion. I knew I was right to consult Shea.”</p>

<p>　When I praised him like that, Shia’s face turned red and shyly said “Ehehe, thank you”.</p>

<p>　This kind of reaction is appropriate for her age.</p>

<p>“What do you want to do?　Should we head for the mountains right away?”</p>

<p>“No, let’s wait until we have a more thorough plan. There is no point in rushing. Success depends on preparation.”</p>

<p>“I see……. As expected of Dyle-sama!　You’re so smart!”</p>

<p>　No matter what I do, I’ll always be liked.</p>

<p>　I felt like I was playing a gal game where there were no wrong choices.</p>

<p>　As I was thinking this, the front door suddenly opened with a bang!　The door opened with a bang, and a villager entered.</p>

<p>“Dyle-san!　Could you please come in right now?”</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>　The villager looked quite flustered.</p>

<p>　I got up from my seat and approached him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“My wife has suddenly collapsed!　She’s in a lot of pain and she’s about to die……!”</p>

<p>“I understand. I’ll be right there.”</p>

<p>　I quieted his distraught voice, told Shea to wait for a moment, and headed for his house.</p>
