<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　A man from the village took me to his house, where I found a woman lying there looking limp.</p>

<p>　Her face was blue and she seemed to be in a lot of pain.</p>

<p>　I bent down beside her to check on her.</p>

<p>“Dyle-san, is my wife going to die?”
<!--more--></p>

<p>“Calm down. I’ll take care of it.”</p>

<p>　I don’t know anything about medicine.</p>

<p>　However, if I can make use of the knowledge from Seven Knights Online, then it’s a different story.  There are many abnormal conditions in the game, but I know what effects they have and how to cure them.</p>

<p>　It’s all basic knowledge for a gamer.</p>

<p>“First of all, we need to check the symptoms. Health Information Visualization 《Vitality Appraisal》 “</p>

<p>　When the magic was activated, a green health bar appeared on the woman’s side.</p>

<p>　Her stamina was already below 10 percent and was still slowly decreasing. She would be in danger if she continued at this rate.</p>

<p>　Next, I looked at the bottom of the bar.</p>

<p>　There I saw a skull icon. The symbol means she was poisoned.</p>

<p>“Husband, Has your wife eaten anything unusual recently?”</p>

<p>“Unusual things, sir?　Let’s see……… Oh. Oh, she said she found some kind of delicious mushrooms.”</p>

<p>“I see, that’s it…….”</p>

<p>　There are different types of poisons, but if it’s mushroom poison, you should be able to easily cure it with magic.</p>

<p>　I activate the recovery magic《 Cure 》 and treat the poison.</p>

<p>　In order to recover the reduced physical strength, I also apply  〈 Recovery 《 Heal 》〉.</p>

<p>“So….. The poison icon is gone, so it should be okay now. The color of her face has improved and she will regain consciousness in a little while. If there are any mushrooms left, please dispose of them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much!　Dyle-san …… no, I don’t know what I would have done if Dyle-sama hadn’t been here!”</p>

<p>　The man cried and thanked me.</p>

<p>　It still feels good to do something good.</p>

<p>“…… but things look serious.”</p>

<p>　This time I managed.</p>

<p>　But just treating them doesn’t mean that this problem is solved.</p>

<p>　The biggest problem in this village.</p>

<p>　It is the food problem.</p>

<p>　The harvest had been poor and the hunting of beasts was not going well.</p>

<p>　It is probably because of the lack of food that this woman ate a mushroom that she did not know well. If you are well fed, you don’t bother to eat things you don’t know.</p>

<p>“We need to do something about it.”</p>

<p>　I’m indebted to this village, and I’m a member of the Silver Knights. I can’t overlook it.</p>

<p>　I’ve got something to do before I can do something about the castle.</p>

<p>◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p>“This way!”</p>

<p>　Shea, running briskly, led me to a field in the village.</p>

<p>　There were a few villagers working on the farm.</p>

<p>“I see. This looks serious.”</p>

<p>　The crops in the field were all so thin that even an amateur like me could see them.</p>

<p>　The faces of the farmers were gloomy.</p>

<p>“How long has this crop failure been going on?”</p>

<p>“Since last year. There have been many days without rain. ……”</p>

<p>　It’s true, it hadn’t even been cloudy once since I arrived. If this weather continued, it would have a strong impact on the crops.</p>

<p>　It seems that it is also difficult to buy food from other places, since peddlers seldom come to the village. They didn’t have much money to begin with.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get on with it.”</p>

<p>　I opened the  《console》 and took out a staff.</p>

<p>　Then Shea looked at it curiously.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama? What is that staff?”</p>

<p>“This is a mistletoe wand. It contains the power of a 《druid》 who controls nature.”</p>

<p>　The green magic used by the 《druid》 cannot be used unless you are a druid.</p>

<p>　My main occupation is a 《holy knight》, so I can’t use it, but I can make up for it by making my secondary occupation a《druid》.</p>

<p>　Unlike my main 《main job》, which is capped at level 10, my secondary 《subjob》 is capped at level 5, so I cannot use all green magic. However, the mistletoe staff I was wearing is a rare item that can raise the level of a druid by two levels.</p>

<p>　In other words, in my current state, I could use green magic equivalent to level 7.</p>

<p>　I can use higher level magic by other means, but for now, this would have to suffice.</p>

<p>　I approached the farmer and talked to him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, may I borrow a patch of this unused field?”</p>

<p>“What?　I don’t mind, but …… the soil there is particularly bad, and I don’t think anything it will grow well.</p>

<p>“That’s fine.”</p>

<p>　After receiving his approval, I went to the front of the field.</p>

<p>　I lightly touched the soil, but it was too dry and looked more like sand than soil. There was no nourishment, and I didn’t see any insects. It certainly doesn’t look like it would be a good place to grow vegetables.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Dyle-sama?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll just have to wait and see, Shea. Green magic, 《Benedict Earth》”</p>

<p>　I thrust my wand into the ground and activated the magic.</p>

<p>　In an instant, the dried up earth was transformed into a fertile land full of nutrients.</p>

<p>　｜Seven Knights Online, the heroic tale of the knight of the Seven Swords, also has an element of agriculture, and this magic was often used at that time.</p>

<p>　If you eat food made from good ingredients, you will get a “buff” that will strengthen you. If you can produce good vegetables, your guild will become stronger. Vegetables and fruits were also produced in the gardens of the White Silver Castle.</p>

<p>　Now everything was ready. All that was left to do was to sow the seeds brought from the castle.</p>

<p>“Green Magic, 《Overgrowth》”</p>

<p>　The next moment I invoked the magic, all the seeds I had planted sprouted at once, filling the entire field with green.</p>

<p>　I sowed the seeds of “Sunrise Tomatoes,” tomatoes whose maximum HP increases when eaten. I’ve already raised my status to the growth limit, so it has no effect on me, but I’m sure it will have an effect on the people in the village, and I’m sure they will all gain strength.</p>

<p>“Wow, wow!　A plant has grown!　Did Dyle-sama do this too?　That’s amazing!”</p>

<p>　Shea’s eyes lit up and she made a lot of noise.</p>

<p>　The villagers, who had been working on the farm, came closer to see what was going on.</p>

<p>　I teared off a tomato and handed it to Shea.</p>

<p>“Can you try it and see if it’s done right?”</p>

<p>“Ha. Yes, I’ll eat it.”</p>

<p>　She opened her big mouth and bit into the tomato.</p>

<p>　She ate it with great gusto.</p>

<p>“This is so delicious!　I’ve never eaten such delicious vegetables before!”</p>

<p>“I see. I’m glad to hear that. Please try some too.”</p>

<p>　As I said this, all the villagers who had been watching the tomatoes reached for them and began to chow down on them.</p>

<p>　They must have been hungry. They were eating them with great gusto.</p>

<p>“What is this?　It’s so good!”</p>

<p>I’m coming back to life. ……!”</p>

<p>“It’s a miracle that such vegetables can be produced in an instant. ……”</p>

<p>　The deliciousness of the vegetables brought smiles to everyone’s faces.</p>

<p>　Some of them even broke down in tears. It must have been very hard for them to be hungry.</p>

<p>“Now, if we are to improve the other fields in turn, …… we must also make it rain.”</p>

<p>　To make the weather snowy or stormy, the druid must be at level 10, but ordinary rain can be made at level 7.</p>

<p>“Weather Control《Rain》.”</p>

<p>　I raised my wand and casted a spell.</p>

<p>　Clouds slowly accumulatde in the sky, and then it began to rain.</p>

<p>　</p>

<p>“The magic was not very useful in Seven Knights Online, but it seems to be very useful in this world.”</p>

<p>　I noticed that the villagers were looking at me with stunned expressions.</p>

<p>　What the heck is this? I’m scared.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama, Are you the one who brought the rain……?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s too much!　He has the power to control even the weather, doesn’t he?　He’s like a god!”</p>

<p>　Shea was excited.</p>

<p>　I noticed that all the villagers were kneeling down and putting their hands together for me. They really are treating me like a god. Well, there are no people who can use even low-level magic, so it’s not surprising that they think I’m a god when they see this kind of large-scale magic.</p>

<p>　I have to be more careful with my tone and behavior than ever before.</p>

<p>　They would be disappointed.</p>

<p>“I will improve the other fields, too. But I want you to take care of the management after the changes are made. Can you do that for me?”</p>

<p>Yes, of course, Master Dyle!　Of course, Mr. Dyle!</p>

<p>　The villagers replied with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>　I feel like they’re getting more like Shea.</p>
