<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>—- and well, this happened before.</p>

<p>　I’ve thought about it a lot since then, and I’ve come to the conclusion that if I want to make someone stronger first, it should be Shea.</p>

<p>　She is a smart girl, but physically she is an ordinary girl. (Tl:  He wants to give power to the devil)</p>

<p>　She seemed to be working a lot for me recently in places I didn’t even know existed, and that seems to have caused her to become fatigued.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　She wouldn’t stop even if I told her that she didn’t have to work so hard. Then I thought it would be good to have a body that would not get tired no matter how much she moves. If she became stronger, she would be able to fight off bandits and other attackers again.</p>

<p>“……We’re almost there.”</p>

<p>　Luna, the beastman walking in the lead, said so.</p>

<p>　Luna and Shea and I were walking through a thick forest.</p>

<p>　The destination was the village where Luna lives. She said we were almost there, but there was no sign of people around us and there was no road. It didn’t seem like there was a village at all.</p>

<p>“We have arrived. That’s the village of Lulu. That’s where I live.”</p>

<p>　Luna pointed in the direction of the village, and sure enough, there it was.</p>

<p>　But it wasn’t like a human village at all. Usually in human villages, trees are cut down and houses are built, but in their village, trees were used as they are and used as houses.</p>

<p>Of course, some trees were cut down to make open spaces, but this was minimal. They were like natives living in the jungle.</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>　I followed Luna into the village.</p>

<p>　It must have been the first time for a human being to come to this village. The beastmen living in the village were staring at us. The children were simply curious, while the adults were wary.</p>

<p>　It was only natural that they would be wary of someone like me in a heavy armor.</p>

<p>　While I was thinking about this, Luna’s footsteps stopped in front of a house.</p>

<p>　It was a simple house made of wood. It was bigger than the other houses, so I wondered if someone important lived there.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>　Luna entered the house saying so.</p>

<p>　After about five minutes of waiting, Luna came out of the house.</p>

<p>“The village chief says he is going to see Dyle-sama. Please do so.”</p>

<p>“I see, it was the village chief’s house. Well…… I’m going to talk to the village chief alone, so I want you two to kill some time at random. I don’t have plans to do anything in particular today, so you can go ahead and play.”</p>

<p>“Eh, but……”</p>

<p>　Shea showed no appreciation for my suggestion.</p>

<p>　Even when we were in the village of Jimari, she was more interested in helping me than playing with me. I’m happy that you want to be of help to me, but it’s also important to have fun once in a while.</p>

<p>　Even though she made a new friend in Luna. I still don’t know what she’s talking about, but I often see them enjoying themselves in the village these days.</p>

<p>　Well, what should I do?</p>

<p>　I could at least have a discussion with the village chief by myself, so I wanted Shea to play and relax.</p>

<p>　But if I told her honestly, she wouldn’t be convinced. I would have to come up with some kind of reason.</p>

<p>“Okay, Shea, I’ll give you a job.”</p>

<p>“Yes!　Anything!”</p>

<p>“We are still under the suspicion of the people of this village, and that’s not good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>

<p>“There. I want you to play nice with Luna and let people know that we are safe and not hostile. I can’t do it this way. I can only ask Shea, who is still very young and is not very intimidating.”</p>

<p>“Only I can …… do this!　I understand, I’ll take care of it!”</p>

<p>　Shea replied with full of motivation.</p>

<p>　Well, I managed to persuade her.</p>

<p>　But even though it was just an idea, it’s a good one, isn’t it?　I feel it’s much more effective than my various other moves.</p>

<p>“Well then, I’ll be counting on you, Shea.”</p>

<p>“Yes!　Plese leave it to me!”</p>

<p>　Leaving Shea in a state of enthusiasm and Luna in a state of blank amazement, I went into the village headman’s house.</p>
