<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Then he said, 「Please help me, please」”</p>

<p>“Ha-ha-ha!　That’s kessak!”</p>

<p>　The bandits chuckled and downed their drinks.</p>

<p>　I didn’t know what they were talking about, but it didn’t sound pleasant.</p>

<p>“…… seems like they don’t know.”</p>

<p>　I stood right next to the bandits, but they didn’t notice anything and were happily chatting and laughing.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　The higher level magic, 《Perfect Invincibility》, is a magic that can even erase the sound of your footsteps and voice. Even when talking to yourself, you won’t be noticed.</p>

<p>“Let’s go inside.”</p>

<p>　I walked past the drunken bandits and continued into the cave.</p>

<p>　The entrance to the cave was littered with food and luggage. Among them were books and other items that these guys don’t seem to have any connection to. Almost everything here must be stolen.</p>

<p>　As I proceeded further into the cave, I came across items that clearly appear to be of value.</p>

<p>　Jewelry and other precious metals, expensive clothing. Weapons that seem to be worth a certain amount of money.</p>

<p>“These guys must have a lot of money in their pockets.”</p>

<p>　I thought they might be the type of people who never have money in their pockets, but maybe they are more solid than I thought.</p>

<p>　I hope they return as much of this stuff as possible to the owners.</p>

<p>“Hmm?　There’s more in here?”</p>

<p>　I thought that was all there was to the cave, but there was more to the cave.</p>

<p>　I wondered what more there was to see, and what I saw was a surprise.</p>

<p>“This is ……!””</p>

<p>　There they were, human …… ‘slaves’.</p>

<p>　There were about ten people in prison, dressed in dirty clothes and bound with shackles and chains.</p>

<p>　They were weak and emaciated to look at. Scratches and bruises here and there on their bodies appeared to be recent, probably caused by bandits.</p>

<p>　Moreover, there was a dead body lying beside them.</p>

<p>　The body bore the marks of a severe beating. This person must have been a slave.</p>

<p>　She was beaten, raped, and killed just for fun. The expression on her face showed the gruesome nature of the assault.</p>

<p>　I remember the revival magic, but in Seven Knights Online, it was ineffective unless it was applied immediately after death. The law would be the same in this world, and it would be impossible to revive this person.</p>

<p>　Besides, would she want to come back to life after such a painful experience?</p>

<p>　I don’t know. I felt it was selfish of me to bring her back to life so recklessly. But even so, ……</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect them to be such lowlifes…….”</p>

<p>　I thought there was room for extenuating circumstances if it seemed to reflect.</p>

<p>　But if they are this bad, it’s a different story. There is no other way but to exterminate them.</p>

<p>　I remembered the world I used to live in.</p>

<p>　The Fifth World War.</p>

<p>　The worst war in human history had reduced the population to one-tenth of what it had been before the war.</p>

<p>　The war was somehow ended, but security worsened worldwide and did not return to normal. It is surprising that slavery is common in some areas.</p>

<p>　Even the laws do not function properly.</p>

<p>　I managed to get a job as a social recluse, but I was accused of crimes I did not remember and was forced to leave the company. Naturally, I appealed to the judiciary, but the voice of the weak are easily suppressed.</p>

<p>　That is why I longed for “justice”.</p>

<p>　Helping the weak and crushing the bad. Such justice.(Tl: It completely skipped my mind that just because he mentioneed dropring out of school early, doesn’t mean he’s still a child)</p>

<p>　Many of the members of the Silver Knights were in similar circumstances to me.</p>

<p>　They were a group of people who had been eliminated and hurt for various reasons such as race, gender, birth, ideology, and religion.</p>

<p>　We were weak, but we wanted to be “righteous” at least in the game. That is how the guild 『Silver Knights』 was born.</p>

<p>“……Ah, yes, I remember now.”</p>

<p>　When I was in elementary school, I was bullied and stopped going to school.</p>

<p>　I had sealed the reason for it in the depths of my memory and had forgotten about it, but now I remembered.</p>

<p>　At that time, I defended another kid who was being bullied. And I became the new target of bullying.</p>

<p>　I miss those days. Back then, I liked Sentai heroes, so I tried to imitate them.</p>

<p>　I was still a child and I didn’t have the power, so I gave in to the bullies.</p>

<p>　But now it’s different. I have power now.</p>

<p>“Hiikku, you stay quiet, you’re merchandise!”</p>

<p>　One of the bandits came to the innermost part of the cave.</p>

<p>　He was staggering around, perhaps having had a lot to drink, occasionally banging himself against the wall.</p>

<p>“Hii……!”</p>

<p>“Don’t make a noise. If you make too much noise, I’ll make you look like the guy lying there.”</p>

<p>　The bandit pointed at the dead bodies.</p>

<p>　The faces of the enslaved people instantly turn blue. Children were crying, and adults were holding their mouths to prevent their voices from escaping.</p>

<p>　These people would have seen one of the slaves being killed up close. No wonder they were scared.</p>

<p>“Ummm yeah…… you, I’ll take you.”</p>

<p>　The bandits let one slave out of the prison.</p>

<p>　She was a girl about the same age as Shea. But the girl was no ordinary human being, she had animal ears growing out of the top of her head. If you look closely, you would see a tail growing out of her buttocks as well.</p>

<p>　Could this be a beastman?</p>

<p>　There was a race with a similar appearance in Seven Knights Online.</p>

<p>　Come to think of it, I heard that there are other races like dwarves, such as elves and beastmen. These guys were enslaving non-humans as well?</p>

<p>“No. ……!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be rash, kid. It’s not my intention to have a bunch of my products destroyed. Shut up and you won’t be hurt.”</p>

<p>　The bandit then tried to peel off the kid’s clothes.</p>

<p>“No, don’t do it, ……!”</p>

<p>“Kukuku! The beastman’s hole is warm, isn’t it? I’m looking forward to it.”</p>

<p>　My patience was running out.</p>

<p>　</p>

<p>“I-Gaaaah!?”</p>

<p>　The bandit fell to the floor in agony.</p>

<p>I caught the freed beastman’s child. Incidentally, the 《Perfect Invincibility》 was already broken when I attacked him. You can’t attack while invisible.</p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>“Eh, hee?”</p>

<p>　The girl I saved was puzzled.</p>

<p>　Of course you’d be surprised. A knight in armor suddenly appeared.</p>

<p>　It’s hard to explain now. I put the child on the floor and turned to the bandit.</p>

<p>　The bandit was reluctant to fight, but he had a knife in his hand and was ready to fight.</p>

<p>“Hey, you!　Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I have no name to give you.”</p>

<p>　When I was a small boy, I was powerless, and I gave in to evil.</p>

<p>　But in this world, I have power. This time I will not fail.</p>

<p>　Now is the time to help the weak and crush the wicked.</p>

<p>”—- I will now execute justice.”</p>
