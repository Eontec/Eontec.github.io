<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　My 《Job》 is a holy knight.</p>

<p>　It is a versatile job that can handle both melee and magic. The unique equipment is also cool and popular.</p>

<p>　However, this “job” is not very popular among the top players.</p>

<p>　The holy knight can do everything on his own, but he is not very versatile. Berserkers” and “mages” are more popular because they are irreplaceable and excel at one thing.</p>

<p>　But I still prefer the holy knight because of its attack speed.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　In guild fights, it is important to be able to produce high firepower and to be able to block the opponent, and the aforementioned jobs have an advantage in these areas.</p>

<p>　However, in individual battles, attack speed is directly related to victory or defeat.</p>

<p>　In the first place, the durability of an individual cannot be increased that much. Even if you have hard armor, it doesn’t matter if you cut through the gap between the armor and the armor.</p>

<p>　The silver flash was accompanied by a metallic sound.</p>

<p>　The slash I shot easily cut through the bandit’s abdomen and took his life.</p>

<p>“You idiot, …….”</p>

<p>　The bandit crumpled to the ground, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</p>

<p>　I swung my sword to remove the blood from the blade and put it back in its scabbard.</p>

<p>　This is the first time I’ve taken a life outside of a game.</p>

<p>　But it’s not as bad as I thought. Is it because my body is an avatar?　Maybe I haven’t lost the feeling that I’m still in the game.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about for a long time……. I have to help them first.”</p>

<p>　I grabbed the prison where the slaves were being held and opened it with force.</p>

<p>The iron cage bent and I was able to get out.</p>

<p>“Oh, are you ……?”</p>

<p>“I am Dyle. I’m here to help you. Let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p>　At these words, the captives burst into joy, and life returned to their eyes.</p>

<p>　Some of them even began to cry.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, How can I thank you ……?”</p>

<p>“That can wait. The bandits are still alive.”</p>

<p>　Their faces quickly turned pale again as I said this.</p>

<p>　I’m wouldn’t lose to any bandit, but I had to take out insurance just to be sure.</p>

<p>“Summoning the 《Call》, Guardian Angel《Sheilder Authority》.”</p>

<p>　An angel with a geometric crystal body was summoned.</p>

<p>　Six shields were floating around it. These shields have a certain strength and moved quite quickly</p>

<p>　They move and guard you quite quickly. I’ve used them in PVP, so I’m familiar with their performance.</p>

<p>“《Shielder Authority》. Protect these people.”</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>　The guardian angel 《Shielder Authority》 responded with a trembling body.</p>

<p>　I’m still worried.</p>

<p>“Um, excuse me.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>　One of the former slaves spoke to me.</p>

<p>　He is a young man, a priest by the looks of him.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it wasn’t an angel you summoned?”</p>

<p>“……. How did you know?”</p>

<p>　In the village of Jimari, there was no one who said such a thing, so I thought that the recognition of angels was low. 　If they can join us, I’d love to bring them in.</p>

<p>“Well, as I thought!　I thought it was not so because they resemble the figures in the Scriptures!　If you can call up angels, then you must be a higher being …… than that, perhaps even God!”</p>

<p>　The priest was excitedly shouting.</p>

<p>　I noticed that the other people were also looking at me with hot gazes. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the priest is a very good man.</p>

<p>　…… They say that lying is also good for you. I can’t help but to inspire their hearts.</p>

<p>“How very true. I am the god who descended from the heavens. Now that I am here, you are safe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!　It is God after all!　What a thankful ……!”</p>

<p>　I sprouted six wings from my back for the service, and everyone started kneeling down to worship me.</p>

<p>　I felt like a guru. No, maybe I’m really becoming one right now. The words “it was a lie,” almost came to my throat, but I managed to swallow them down.</p>

<p>　I hope it won’t be too much trouble.</p>

<p>“Then let’s kick off the rest of the bandits and go home. Come with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dyle-sama!”</p>

<p>　I headed out of the cave with the former slaves, their eyes shining brightly.</p>
