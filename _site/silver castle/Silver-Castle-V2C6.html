<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　I walked through the cave with those who had been captured.</p>

<p>　I cast a 《Heal》 spell on them, so that they would be light on their feet.</p>

<p>“Um… Thank you, just now.”</p>

<p>“Hmmm?”</p>

<p>　The one who spoke to me was the beastman girl who had been attacked by bandits.
<!--more--></p>

<p>　A child with white hair and strong-willed eyes.  She has a pretty face.</p>

<p>“It’s only natural to help those in need. Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m a beastman, is that okay with you?”</p>

<p>　The girl makes an apologetic face.</p>

<p>　I have a vague idea of what’s going on. I am sure that beastmen are not treated well in this world. She feels guilty about it.</p>

<p>　Even if they look the same, just because they are from different countries, there will be conflicts. If they look very different like this, there will be a lot of discrimination. I am sure this child must have had a hard time.</p>

<p>“Of course not. Beastmen and humans are the same to me, and I am the one who should protect them.”</p>

<p>“Beastmen and humans are …… the same …….”</p>

<p>　The girl repeated my words.</p>

<p>　I wonder if it was the first time she was told that; she looked dumbfounded and dazed.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Uh, I’m Luna.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a nice name.”</p>

<p>　I pat her fluffy head.</p>

<p>　Shea’s soft hair is also a nice touch, but Luna’s hair has a different flavor. It’s hard to say which is better.</p>

<p>　As we were exchanging pleasantries, we reached the exit of the cave.</p>

<p>　I stopped the people behind me with my hand and went out alone.</p>

<p>“Hey!　No more booze?”</p>

<p>“You’re drinking too much by yourself!”</p>

<p>“Hey, let’s go get a slave and play with them. I’m tired of drinking with you.”</p>

<p>“Idiot! Don’t destroy any more goods.”</p>

<p>Outside the cave, the bandits were still feasting.</p>

<p>　When I was thinking about how to deal with them, one of the thieves found me.</p>

<p>“Hey, you —-“</p>

<p>“《Slash!》”</p>

<p>　I snapped my fingers and activated the magic, and the bandit’s body was cut in two and crumpled to the ground.</p>

<p>　《Slash》 is a slightly special magic, a magic that can only be used while swinging a sword. It’s a convenient magic that can be fired many times in succession because it has good magic power consumption in exchange for the condition.</p>

<p>　However, I realized that the activation condition for this magic is not “swinging the sword” but “moving the metal quickly”.</p>

<p>　Therefore, even if you have a metal gaunlet equipped and you snap your fingers, the activation condition for the “slash” spell is met. This technique is not even listed in the Wiki, so it confuses the opponent when you show it off, but the last two players I fought were too novice to realize how great it was.</p>

<p>“Who are you!  Where did you come from!”</p>

<p>　The bandits all picked up their weapons and readied them, but their drunkenness made them unsteady on their feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll let one of you live, if you give up all your information.”</p>

<p>“Who would do such a thing?　You’ll die!”</p>

<p>　The offer was turned down.</p>

<p>　I guess if I kill a few people, some will surrender, but it’s a pain in the ass to think about betraying them.</p>

<p>　…… Ah. That’s right. I think we can use that magic, don’t you?　I point to a bandit and invoke the magic.</p>

<p>“《Conversion》”</p>

<p>　The thief who was hit with the magic moved his body with a jerk and then went rigid.</p>

<p>　The magic I just used is a spiritual magic. It is a magic that makes the hostility of the enemy monster disappear. If the opponent’s level is low, you can make them listen to what you say.</p>

<p>　But since players and even high-level monsters have resistance to mental magic, it was never really useful, but in this world, it seems to be useful.</p>

<p>“Come here.”</p>

<p>“As you wish …….”</p>

<p>　The bandit came to my side with a vacant look in his eyes.</p>

<p>　Okay, it looks like it’s working.</p>

<p>“Oh, hey!　What are you doing?”</p>

<p>　The bandits called out, but the effect of the 《Conversion》 was so great that their words didn’t reach me at all. The bandit were not able to hear a word they were saying.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try a few things, Summon 《Call》・ 《Angel Knight》”</p>

<p>　I summoned two Angel Knights and sent them to the thieves.</p>

<p>　The thieves were puzzled by the sudden appearance of the mysterious knights, but they fought back boldly. They attacked the Angel Knights’ armor with swords, bows, and spears, but were unable to inflict a single scratch.</p>

<p>“Hi, hi!”</p>

<p>　One of the 《Angel Knight》 slices through the bandit’s body.</p>

<p>　I haven’t given any orders since I summoned it. The fact that they attacked on their own means that my thoughts are being shared with them?</p>

<p>　I tried to think in my head, “Come back!” But the Angel Knight didn’t respond and slashed at its next prey.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a good thing that he knows how I felt when I summoned him. If it’s a simple command, then there’s no need to bother with it.”</p>

<p>　The summoned monsters that were in Seven Knights Online also acted on their own to our advantage. It seems to be the ssae in this world too.</p>

<p>“The biggest change is the amount of MP consumption. Well, it’s only natural that it increases considering that it doesn’t disappear on its own.”</p>

<p>　The MP consumption of summoning magic was several times higher than in Seven Knights Online. If it was in the game, I could have put out more than 100 Angel Knights at once.</p>

<p>　The reason for the increase is that the summoned monsters do not automatically return and remain in this world. It’s like creating a new life, so I’m willing to tolerate a lot of MP consumption.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to work.”</p>

<p>　I spotted a bandit who wasn’t a target for the Angel Knights and approached him.</p>

<p>　The bandit, who already understood the difference in ability, looked frightened.</p>

<p>“You know, you’re not like that monster!　Unlike that monster, you can talk to me, can’t you?　I surrender, I surrender, just save my life!　I’ll tell you anything you want, and I’ll give you everything we stole!　Okay?　Okay?”</p>

<p>　Rubbing his head against the ground, the bandit man pleaded.</p>

<p>　His face was a mess of tears. He must have meant what he said.</p>

<p>“Look up!”</p>

<p>“Ha, Yes!”</p>

<p>　He got down on his knees in front of me and raised his face.</p>

<p>　The light returned to the man’s eyes a little, perhaps because he thought I would miss it.</p>

<p>“It seems that you are sorry for what you have done.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am!　From now on, I’m going to live a straight life!”</p>

<p>“I see. ……”</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh.</p>

<p>Then, with unseen speed, I drew my sword and stabbed him through the abdomen.　</p>

<p>“To ……?”</p>

<p>　Blood spurts from the man’s mouth.</p>

<p>　The man turned his gaze to his stomach, and only then did he realize that he had been cut.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Have you ever shown mercy to a man begging for his life?”</p>

<p>“So …… n, na ……”</p>

<p>　The dead man collapsed on the spot.</p>

<p>　Looking at it, all the other bandits had been slaughtered by the hands of the 《Angel Knight》. It is in a terrible state with blood all over it. I can’t tell which one is the bad guy just by looking at them.</p>

<p>“Angel Knights, please clean up the bodies as you see fit.”</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>　The two angel knights heard my order and started throwing the bandits’ dead bodies into the bushes. It’s a little messy, but that’s okay.</p>

<p>　I hope they don’t catch the eye of the people hiding in the cave.</p>

<p>“You can come out now.”</p>

<p>　After most of the corpses were out of sight, I called for the people who had been captured.</p>

<p>　They all showed their faces at first, as if to check. Eventually they realized that the bandits were gone and rushed outside.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you, Dyle-sama…….”</p>

<p>　The priest, who knew the angel, spoke to me.</p>

<p>　He is holding his hands together as he dabs his tears for the first time today.</p>

<p>“It’s too early to thank you yet. I have to talk to him.”</p>

<p>I point to the bandit who was under the effects of 《Conversion》 .</p>

<p>　His eyes were still slurred and his consciousness was still unclear. The effect of this magic wore off quickly in Seven Knights Online, but it seems to last quite a while here.</p>

<p>“Then let’s get you to answer the question. Is that okay?”</p>

<p>“Yes…… as you wish…….”</p>

<p>　I asked the bandits where the treasure, people, and food they had stolen originally came from.</p>

<p>　All of them had been stolen from a nearby village, and it wouldn’t take much to return them. I would just put them in my item box and carry them away and it would be done in a day.</p>

<p>“…… do you guys have any other companions?”</p>

<p>“……Yes, we do.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t realize that. Where are they now?”</p>

<p>‘…… Jimari, a village. They left quite a while ago …… to get more food.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p>　I didn’t think they would attack twice today.</p>

<p>　The priest saw that I was upset and looked worried.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama, if that village is so important to you, then you should immediately take care of it.”</p>

<p>　The others nodded at the priest’s words.</p>

<p>　But I refused their offer.</p>

<p>“I will not leave you. If I help you, I will take care of you until the end.”</p>

<p>“But even as we speak, the bandits are still on their way to ……!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve reached the village by now.”</p>

<p>　That’s a strong possibility.</p>

<p>　But I was in no hurry.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. That village has my men and …… a commander who is smarter than I am.”</p>

<p>…..</p>

<p>Tl Note: I could puush out more chapters today, but I’ll stop here and resume studying</p>
