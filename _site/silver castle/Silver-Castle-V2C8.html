<p>　Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　It was the 《Angel Arrow》, a magic used by angels. It is less powerful, but comes out quickly and has a slight holy attribute.</p>

<p>　It’s a magic that doesn’t serve as a deterrent against players, but it’s quite effective against thieves.</p>

<p>“Ugh, ah……!”</p>

<p>　 The bandit’s face contorted in pain as he held his thigh, which had a hole in it.</p>

<p>　 The bandit’s face is contorted in pain as he holds the hole in his thigh.</p>

<p>“Why are you doing this?”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　 The bandit asks Shea, who was the only one he could communicate with.</p>

<p>　 The Angel Knights were listening to her. If that is the case, “we can survive if only we can persuade her”, That’s what he thought.</p>

<p>“We are indeed thieves!　Your village might have been damaged!　But I apologize …… for that. I will pay you back double for what we stole, so just save our lives!　Please!”</p>

<p>　The bandit bowed his head with sincerity, his eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>　As long as he could get through this moment, the rest would not matter.</p>

<p>　Fortunately, the other party was a young child. He thought that if he could cry his eyes out, they would listen to what he had to say.</p>

<p>　Unfortunately, what he saw in front of him was no ordinary child.(Tl: Nope, T’was the devil)</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but I’m not doing this because I hate you people.”</p>

<p>“hee……?”</p>

<p>　The bandit was puzzled by the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>　 At the same time, a chill rose in his heart. The feeling of a chance encounter with an unknown entity. It was the first time he had ever had such a creepy feeling.</p>

<p>“I was entrusted by him (・・・・) with the defense. This is the first order he has given me. I must succeed perfectly. It would not be perfect if we did not let a single step into the village, eliminate all the intruders, and capture a few more alive. I will spare no effort to do so.”</p>

<p>“Hii……!”</p>

<p>　The bandit was frightened by Shea’s words, which sounded almost insane, and he let out a pitiful cry.(Tl: The devil, I tell you)</p>

<p>“I will not kill you, the most important person here. But …… I’m going to ask you to be a little more honest so that when he comes back, you will open up to him.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>　Shea tapped the 《Angel Knight》she was riding.</p>

<p>　Then, the angel knight swung his sword and cut off the thief’s leg that wasn’t hit.</p>

<p>”—-aaaaaarrrr！！！！？？？？”</p>

<p>　 The bandit screamed in agony from the pain.</p>

<p>　Naturally, a large amount of blood flowed from the cut surface, staining the ground red.</p>

<p>“《Angel Knight》, Please recover.”</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>　 Hearing Shea’s order, the angel knight casted a 《heal》 on the bandit. It wasn’t the best recovery magic, but it was capable of stopping blood. The pain wouldn’t go away, but for now he wouldn’t die of blood loss.</p>

<p>“Now, a few questions…… before that gentleman arrives, have you already passed out?”</p>

<p>　The bandit’s eyes were white and he was lying limp on the ground.</p>

<p>　The pain of having his leg cut off was that terrible.</p>

<p>　The other bandits have already been taken care of by the angel knight and the archangel knight.</p>

<p>　Silence returned to the forest. Shea confirms that she had accomplished her task and pulled out a small picture book from her pocket.</p>

<p>　On the cover of the book was an angel.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama …… I have successfully completed my mission.”</p>

<p>　Shea put her cheek against the book. The book was a treasure for her.</p>

<p>　Since she was a little girl, she had always known that she was smarter than others.</p>

<p>　Although she was kind-hearted and did not look down on others because of it, she had a hard time. She could not talk to anyone and could not converse comfortably. It was quite stressful for her.</p>

<p>　The only thing that saved her was the time she spent reading books and immersing herself in them.</p>

<p>　Then she came across this book.</p>

<p>　 The book was about a young man who had experienced various kinds of suffering and was saved when he met an angel.</p>

<p>　Shea saw herself in the main character. She felt that she was just like him, living in pain and not fitting in with others. She wished that an angel would appear to her as well —-.</p>

<p>　 But deep down, she had given up on the idea that such a thing would ever happen.</p>

<p>　But for some unknown reason, that dream came true.</p>

<p>　Her dream came true. No wonder she thought so. The encounter with Dyle was that much too good to be true.</p>

<p>　With his arrival, Shea had found a place where she could use her brains. This was the happiest thing for her. It did not take long for her to develop respect for and faith in Dyle.</p>

<p>“Please continue to use me, Dyle-sama, I was born for that purpose—-“</p>

<p>　In the quiet forest, Shea smiled a bewitching smile.</p>
