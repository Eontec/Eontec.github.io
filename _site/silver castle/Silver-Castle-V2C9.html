<p>Tl: Sam</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>　After defeating the bandits in the cave and saving the people who were being held captive, I returned to the Jimari village.</p>

<p>　I could have returned home immediately by riding the angel I summoned, but the captives, especially the priest, refused, saying, “ That’s absurd!” I had to walk home.</p>

<p>　Angels are just monsters that I can summon as many as I want, but to the people here, they are sacred beings.</p>

<p>　I should not treat them too carelessly.</p>

<p>“Welcome back, Dyle-sama!”
<!--more--></p>

<p>　Shea was the first to rush up to me.</p>

<p>　The bandits must have come to the village, but they didn’t look particularly tired. I wonder if there weren’t enough of them.</p>

<p>“I’m home, Shea. It looks like you protected the village, great job.”</p>

<p>“Heh heh.”</p>

<p>　When I patted her head, Shea’s face relaxed.</p>

<p>　When I see things like this, I feel like a child. I have to be careful not to do anything too shocking. If she sees blood or something, she’ll probably get hurt.(Tl: She’s actually the devil)</p>

<p>“Well, you know. I have captured the most important of the bandits who came to the village.”</p>

<p>“What?　You did that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Yes. He is tied up in that warehouse.”</p>

<p>　I didn’t think she had done her job that perfectly.</p>

<p>　I guess it was the right decision to leave it to 《Angel Knight》.</p>

<p>“Hmm… However, I’ve already heard everything I wanted to ask from the other thieves, so I don’t think there’s anything I want to ask now. I’m sorry you went to the trouble of catching him.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t be sorry!　I did it on my own!　…… Well, what do you want me to do then?　Shall I get rid of it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave such a dirty thing to Shea. I will give the order from my side.”</p>

<p>　I’m going to give an order to the angel knight who is standing by and have him dispose of the bandit.</p>

<p>　Incidentally, the bandits I brainwashed with Conversion had already been disposed of. There is no mercy for the wicked.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I brought the captured people and the stolen goods from the bandit’s hideout. I’m sorry, but may I ask you to take care of these?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!　Of course!　I’m very good at that kind of detail!”</p>

<p>　Shea replied happily.</p>

<p>　The first time I asked her for a favor, I was a little hesitant to do so, but recently I feel that I have lost my hesitation.</p>

<p>“You can use the summoned Angel Knights as you like. Please help me.”</p>

<p>“Yup!　Leave it to me!”</p>

<p>　Shea was full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>　I’d have to do my best to keep up with her work.</p>

<p>◇　◇　◇</p>

<p>　One week after the bandit trouble.</p>

<p>　Thanks to the efforts of Shea and the other villagers, almost all of those who had been captured were able to return to their former villages.</p>

<p>　The few who hadn’t returned are still in the Jimari village. They don’t want to leave me. I felt sorry for them, so I built them a new house in the village. By the way, the priest was among them, and he worshiped me every time he saw me.</p>

<p>　I am returning stolen goods little by little to their original owners.</p>

<p>　If you go to a village once, you can ask an angel you summoned to take your belongings and it’s not that hard. Recently, it seems that what I have done has begun to spread to neighboring villages, and there are people who come all the way to the village of Jimari to see me.</p>

<p>　I don’t want to be too conspicuous, but Shea is doing a good job of keeping me out of trouble. It’s like she’s my secretary.</p>

<p>　Oh, and one more thing has changed.</p>

<p>　Shea, who had not been talking to many other people her age, has made a friend.</p>

<p>　She made a friend, Luna, a beastman. She was one of the people I rescued from the cave.</p>

<p>　She was living with other beastmen in the forest near the village of Jimari. She often came to the village and talked happily with Shea about something.</p>

<p>　It’s good to have friends. I hope that she will nurture her friendship and make many good memories for me.</p>

<p>　Well, things were hectic but peaceful these days.</p>

<p>　Just as I was thinking that it was time to start doing something to fix the castle, Luna, who was visiting the village, asked me for a favor.</p>

<p>“Dyle-sama. Actually, there is something I need your help with…….”</p>

<p>　Luna began using an unfamiliar honorific.</p>

<p>　Her face was dark. Is it something serious?</p>

<p>“What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“Orcs have been appearing near my village recently. But my people are no match for them, and if we don’t do something about it, we will be killed one day…….”</p>

<p>　The orcs are pig-headed subhumans, as I recall. they also appeared in Seven Knights Online.</p>

<p>　Although it moved slowly, it was a troublesome monster with high strength and stamina.</p>

<p>　It didn’t drop very good items, and it wasn’t a monster I would actively hunt.</p>

<p>　However, if they came close to where you live, there is no way to avoid them. This was a serious problem.</p>

<p>　I asked Shea, who was standing nearby.</p>

<p>“Shea, how many days do you think you can stay away from the village?”</p>

<p>“About three days is no problem. I can accompany you for that period of time!”</p>

<p>　Shea replied in no time. She is a very capable girl, as always.</p>

<p>“I see, it’s perfect if Shea can come too. I have some things I want to try, so let’s go to the village of Luna.”</p>

<p>“…… eh!　Dyle-sama is coming?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will. It’s only natural to help out a friend in need.”</p>

<p>　I patted Luna’s fluffy head.</p>

<p>　Luna’s tail wagged in delight. She was shy and didn’t show it in words or facial expressions, but she was still a child when she showed it in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>　…..I feel like Shea was looking at me in a scary way, but I thought it was just my imagination.</p>

<p>“By the way, Dyle-sama, what is it that you want to try?”</p>

<p>　I stopped stroking her and she asked me curiously.</p>

<p>　I hadn’t told her about this yet, come to think of it.</p>

<p>“Even with the angels I summon, there is still a lack of strength. That’s what I think.”</p>

<p>“I see. ……. I do not think there is any problem with the current situation, but if Dyle-sama says so, then there must be no doubt about it.”</p>

<p>　Certainly, as Shea said, if you look at it from a general perspective, the strength of this village is not a problem.</p>

<p>　Since we summon various kinds of angels every day, we usually see them in the village. Even if we fought a big country, we have the strength here that we would not be defeated so easily.</p>

<p>　But what if a player came from Seven Knights Online?</p>

<p>　I doubt if I and my summoned angels would be enough to win. Even if we could win, I don’t have confidence in my ability to protect people over here like Shea and Luna.</p>

<p>“I thought about it. How can I protect the people of this village? And I came to a conclusion.”</p>

<p>　Shea and Luna gulped when they heard these words.</p>

<p>　Both of them are curious. After I had made a big show of it, I said those words.</p>

<p>“It’s time for leveling.”</p>
